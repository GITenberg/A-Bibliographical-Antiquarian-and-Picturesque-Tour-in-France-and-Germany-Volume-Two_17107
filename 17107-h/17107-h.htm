<P>PARIS. THE BOULEVARDS. PUBLIC BUILDINGS. STREET SCENERY. FOUNTAINS.<A
name="fnref_1"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_1">1</A></P>

<P><EM>Paris, June 18, 1818</EM>.</P>

<P>You are probably beginning to wonder at the tardiness of my promised
Despatch, in which the architectural minutiæ of this City were to be
somewhat systematically described. But, as I have told you towards the
conclusion of my previous letter, it would be to very little purpose to
conduct you over every inch of ground which had been trodden and described
by a host of Tourists, and from which little of interest or of novelty
could be imparted. Yet it seems to be absolutely incumbent upon me to say
<EM>something</EM> by way of local description.</P>

<P>Perhaps the BOULEVARDS form the most interesting feature about Paris. I
speak here of the <EM>principal</EM> Boulevards:--of those, extending from
<EM>Ste. Madelaine</EM> to <EM>St. Antoine</EM>; which encircle nearly one
half the capital. Either on foot, or in a carriage, they afford you
singular gratification. A very broad road way, flanked by two rows of
trees on each side, within which the population of Paris seems to be in
incessant agitation--lofty houses, splendid shops, occasionally a retired
mansion, with a parterre of blooming flowers in front--all manner of
merchandize exposed in the open air--prints, muslins,
<EM>kaleidoscopes</EM>, (they have just introduced them<A name=
"fnref_2"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_2">2</A>) trinkets, and
especially watch chains and strings of beads, spread in gay colours upon
the ground--the undulations of the chaussée--and a bright blue sky above
the green trees--all these things irresistibly rivet the attention and
extort the admiration of a stranger. You may have your boots cleaned, and
your breakfast prepared, upon these same boulevards. Felicitous junction
of conveniences!</P>

<P>This however is only a hasty sketch of what may be called a morning
scene. AFTERNOON approaches: then, the innumerable chairs, which have been
a long time unoccupied, are put into immediate requisition: then commences
the "high exchange" of the loungers. One man hires two chairs, for which
he pays two sous: he places his legs upon one of them; while his body, in
a slanting position, occupies the other. The places, where these chairs
are found, are usually flanked by coffee houses. Incessant reports from
drawing the corks of beer bottles resound on all sides. The ordinary
people are fond of this beverage; and for four or six sous they get a
bottle of pleasant, refreshing, small beer. The draught is usually
succeeded by a doze--in the open air. What is common, excites no surprise;
and the stream of population rushes on without stopping one instant to
notice these somniferous indulgences. Or, if they are not disposed to
sleep, they sit and look about them: abstractedly gazing upon the
multitude around, or at the heavens above. Pure, idle, unproductive
listlessness is the necessary cause of such enjoyment.</P>

<P>Evening approaches: when the Boulevards put on their gayest and most
fascinating livery. Then commences the bustle of the <EM>Ice Mart</EM>: in
other words, then commences the general demand for ices: while the rival
and neighbouring <EM>caffés</EM> of TORTONI and RICHE have their porches
of entrance choked by the incessant ingress and egress of customers. The
full moon shines beautifully above the foliage of the trees; and an equal
number of customers, occupying chairs, sit without, and call for ices to
be brought to them. Meanwhile, between these loungers, and the entrances
to the caffés, move on, closely wedged, and yet scarcely in perceptible
motion, the mass of human beings who come only to exercise their eyes, by
turning them to the right or to the left: while, on the outside, upon the
chaussée, are drawn up the carriages of visitors (chiefly English ladies)
who prefer taking their ice within their closed morocco quarters. The
varieties of ice are endless, but that of the <EM>Vanille</EM> is justly a
general favourite: not but that you may have coffee, chocolate, punch,
peach, almond, and in short every species of gratification of this kind;
while the glasses are filled to a great height, in a pyramidal shape, and
some of them with layers of strawberry, gooseberry, and other coloured
ice--looking like pieces of a Harlequin's jacket--are seen moving to and
fro, to be silently and certainly devoured by those who bespeak them. Add
to this, every one has his tumbler and small water-bottle by the side of
him: in the centre of the bottle is a large piece of ice, and with a
tumbler of water, poured out from it, the visitor usually concludes his
repast. The most luxurious of these ices scarcely exceeds a shilling of
our money; and the quantity is at least half as much again as you get at a
certain well-known confectioner's in Piccadilly.</P>

<P>It is getting towards MIDNIGHT; but the bustle and activity of the
Boulevards have not yet much abated. Groups of musicians, ballad-singers,
tumblers, actors, conjurors, slight-of-hand professors, and raree-shew
men, have each their distinct audiences. You advance. A little girl with a
raised turban (as usual, tastefully put on) seems to have no mercy either
upon her own voice or upon the hurdy-gurdy on which she plays: her father
shews his skill upon a violin, and the mother is equally active with the
organ; after "a flourish"--not of "trumpets"--but of these
instruments--the tumblers commence their operations. But a great crowd is
collected to the right. What may this mean? All are silent; a ring is
made, of which the boundaries are marked by small lighted candles stuck in
pieces of clay. Within this circle stands a man--apparently strangled:
both arms are extended, and his eyes are stretched to their utmost limits.
You look more closely--and the hilt of a dagger is seen in his mouth, of
which the blade is introduced into his stomach! He is almost breathless,
and ready to faint--but he approaches, with the crown of a hat in one
hand, into which he expects you should drop a sous. Having made his
collection, he draws forth the dagger from its carnal sheath, and, making
his bow, seems to anticipate the plaudits which invariably follow.<A name=
"fnref_3"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_3">3</A> Or, he changes his plan
of operations on the following evening. Instead of the dagger put down his
throat, he introduces a piece of wire up one nostril, to descend by the
other--and, thus self-tortured, demands the remuneration and the applause
of his audience. In short, from one end of the Boulevards to the other,
for nearly two English miles, there is nought but animation, good humour,
and, it is right to add, good order;--while, having strolled as far as the
Boulevards <EM>de Bondy</EM>, and watched the moon-beams sparkling in the
waters which play there within the beautiful fountain so called,--I
retread my steps, and seek the quiet quarters in which this epistle is
penned.</P>

<P>The next out-of-door sources of gratification, of importance, are the
<EM>Gardens of the Thuileries</EM>, the <EM>Champs Elysées</EM>, and the
promenade within the <EM>Palais Royal</EM>; in which latter plays a small,
but, in my humble opinion, the most beautifully constructed fountain which
Paris can boast of. Of this, presently. The former of these spots is
rather pretty than picturesque: rather limited than extensive: a raised
terrace to the left, on looking from the front of the Thuileries, is the
only commanding situation--from which you observe the Seine, running with
its green tint, and rapid current, to the left--while on the right you
leisurely examine the rows of orange trees and statuary which give an
imposing air of grandeur to the scene. At this season of the year, the
fragrance of the blossoms of the orange trees is most delicious. The
statues are of a colossal, and rather superior kind ... for garden
decoration. There are pleasing vistas and wide gravel walks, and a fine
evening usually fills them with crowds of Parisians. The palace is long,
but rather too low and narrow; yet there is an air of elegance about it,
which, with the immediately surrounding scenery, cannot fail to strike you
very agreeably. The white flag of St. Louis floats upon the top of the
central dome. The <EM>Champs Elysées</EM> consist of extensive wooded
walks; and a magnificent road divides them, which serves as the great
attractive mall for carriages--especially on Sundays--while, upon the
grass, between the trees, on that day, appear knots of male and female
citizens enjoying the waltz or quadrille. It is doubtless a most singular,
and animated scene: the utmost order and good humour prevailing. The
<EM>Place Louis Quinze</EM>, running at right angles with the Thuileries,
and which is intersected in your route to the <EM>Rue de la Paix</EM>, is
certainly a most magnificent front elevation; containing large and
splendid houses, of elaborate exterior ornament. When completed, to the
right, it will present an almost matchless front of domestic architecture,
built upon the Grecian model. It was in this place, facing his own regal
residence of the Thuileries, that the unfortunate Louis--surrounded by a
ferocious and bloodthirsty mob--was butchered by the guillotine.</P>

<P>Come back with me now into the very heart of Paris, and let us stroll
within the area of the <EM>Palais Royal</EM>. You may remember that I
spoke of a fountain, which played within the centre of this popular
resort. The different branches, or <EM>jets d'eau</EM>, spring from a low,
central point; and crossing each other in a variety of angles, and in the
most pleasing manner of intersection, produce, altogether, the appearance
of the blossom of a large flower: so silvery and transparent is the water,
and so gracefully are its glassy petals disposed. Meanwhile, the rays of
the sun, streaming down from above, produce a sort of stationary rainbow:
and, in the heat of the day, as you sit upon the chairs, or saunter
beneath the trees, the effect is both grateful and refreshing. The little
flower garden, in the centre of which this fountain seems to be for ever
playing, is a perfect model of neatness and tasteful disposition: not a
weed dare intrude: and the earth seems always fresh and moist from the
spray of the fountain--while roses, jonquils, and hyacinths scatter their
delicious fragrance around. For one minute only let us visit the <EM>Caffé
des Mille Colonnes</EM>: so called (as you well know) from the number of
upright mirrors and glasses which reflect the small columns by which the
ceiling is supported. Brilliant and singular as is this effect, it is
almost eclipsed by the appearance of the Mistress of the House; who,
decorated with rich and rare gems, and seated upon a sort of elevated
throne--uniting great comeliness and (as some think) beauty of
person--receives both the homage and (what is doubtless preferable to her)
the <EM>francs</EM> of numerous customers and admirers. The "wealth of
either Ind" sparkles upon her hand, or glitters upon her attire: and if
the sun of her beauty be somewhat verging towards its declension, it sets
with a glow which reminds her old acquaintance of the splendour of its
noon-day power. It is yet a sharply contested point whether the ice of
this house be preferable to that of Tortoni: a point, too intricate and
momentous for my solution. "Non nostrum est ... tantas componere
lites."</P>

<P>Of the <EM>Jardin des Plantes</EM>, which I have once visited, but am
not likely to revisit--owing to the extreme heat of the weather, and the
distance of the spot from this place--scarcely too much can be said in
commendation: whether we consider it as a <EM>dépôt</EM> for live or dead
animals, or as a school of study and instruction for the cultivators of
natural history. The wild animals are kept, in their respective cages, out
of doors, which is equally salutary for themselves and agreeable to their
visitors. I was much struck by the perpetual motion of a huge, restless,
black bear, who has left the marks of his footsteps by a concavity in the
floor:--as well as by the panting, and apparently painful, inaction of an
equally huge white or gray bear--who, nurtured upon beds of Greenland ice,
seemed to be dying beneath the oppressive heat of a Parisian atmosphere.
The same misery appeared to beset the bears who are confined, in an open
space, below. They searched every where for shade; while a scorching sun
was darting its vertical rays upon their heads. In the Museum of dead, or
stuffed animals, you have every thing that is minute or magnificent in
nature, from the creeping lizard to the towering giraffe, arranged
systematically, and in a manner the most obvious and intelligible: while
Cuvier's collection of fossil bones equally surprises and instructs you.
It is worth all the <EM>catacombs</EM> of all the capitals in the world.
If we turn to the softer and more beauteous parts of creation, we are
dazzled and bewildered by the radiance and variety of the tribes of
vegetables--whether as fruits or flowers; and, upon the whole, this is an
establishment which, in no age or country, hath been surpassed.</P>

<P>It is not necessary to trouble you with much more of this strain. The
out-of-door enjoyments in Paris are so well known, and have been so
frequently described--and my objects of research being altogether of a
very different complexion--you will not, I conclude, scold me if I cease
to expatiate upon this topic, but direct your attention to others. Not
however but that I think you may wish to know my sentiments about the
principal ARCHITECTURAL BUILDINGS of Paris--as you are yourself not only a
lover, but a judge, of these matters--and therefore the better qualified
to criticise and correct the following remarks--which flow "au bout de la
plume"--as Madame de Sévigné says. In the first place, then, let us stop a
few minutes before the THUILERIES. It hath a beautiful front: beautiful
from its lightness and airiness of effect. The small central dome is the
only raised part in the long horizontal line of this extended building:
not but what the extremities are raised in the old fashioned sloping
manner: but if there had been a similar dome at each end, and that in the
centre had been just double its present height, the effect, in my humble
opinion, would have harmonised better with the extreme length of the
building. It is very narrow; so much so, that the same room contains
windows from which you may look on either side of the palace: upon the
gardens to the west, or within the square to the east.</P>

<P>Adjoining to the Thuileries is the LOUVRE: that is to say, a long range
of building to the south, parallel with the Seine, connects these
magnificent residences: and it is precisely along this extensive range
that the celebrated <EM>Gallery of the Louvre</EM> runs. The principal
exterior front, or southern extremity of the Louvre, faces the Seine; and
to my eye it is nearly faultless as a piece of architecture constructed
upon Grecian and Roman models. But the interior is yet more splendid. I
speak more particularly of the south and western fronts: that facing the
north being more ancient, and containing female figure ornaments which are
palpably of a disproportionate length. The Louvre quadrangle (if I may
borrow our old college phrase) is assuredly the most splendid piece of
ornamental architecture which Paris contains. The interior of the edifice
itself is as yet in an unfinished condition;<A name="fnref_4"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_4">4</A> but you must not conclude the examination
of this glorious pile of building, without going round to visit the
<EM>eastern</EM> exterior front--looking towards Notre-Dame. Of all sides
of the square, within or without, this colonnade front is doubtless the
most perfect of its kind. It is less rich and crowded with ornament than
any side of the interior--but it assumes one of the most elegant, airy,
and perfectly proportionate aspects, of any which I am just now able to
recollect. Perhaps the basement story, upon which this double columned
colonnade of the Corinthian Order runs, is somewhat too plain--a sort of
affectation of the rustic. The alto-relievo figures in the centre of the
tympanum have a decisive and appropriate effect. The advantage both of the
Thuileries and Louvre is, that they are well seen from the principal
thoroughfares of Paris: that is to say, along the quays, and from the
chief streets running from the more ancient parts on the south side of the
Seine. The evil attending our own principal public edifices is, that they
are generally constructed where they <EM>cannot</EM> be seen to advantage.
Supposing one of the principal entrances or malls of London, both for
carriages and foot, to be on the <EM>south</EM> side of the Thames, what
could be more magnificent than the front of <EM>Somerset House</EM>,
rising upon its hundred columns perpendicularly from the sides of a river
... three times as broad as the Seine, with the majestic arches of
<EM>Waterloo Bridge!</EM>--before which, however, the stupendous elevation
of <EM>St. Paul's</EM> and its correspondent bridge of <EM>Black
Friars</EM>, could not fail to excite the wonder, and extort the praise,
of the most anti-anglican stranger. And to crown the whole, how would the
venerable nave and the towers of <EM>Westminster Abbey</EM>--with its
peculiar bridge of Westminster ... give a finish to such a succession of
architectural objects of metropolitan grandeur! Although in the very
heart, of Parisian wonder, I cannot help, you see, carrying my imagination
towards our own capital; and suggesting that, if, instead of furnaces,
forges, and flickering flames--and correspondent clouds of dense
smoke--which give to the southern side of the Thames the appearance of its
being the abode of legions of blacksmiths, and glass and shot makers--we
introduced a little of the good taste and good sense of our
neighbours--and if ... But all this is mighty easily said-- though not
quite so easily put in practice. The truth however is, my dear friend,
that we should <EM>approximate</EM> a little towards each other. Let the
Parisians attend somewhat more to our domestic comforts and commercial
advantages--and let the Londoners sacrifice somewhat of their love of
warehouses and manufactories--and then you will have hit the happy medium,
which, in the metropolis of a great empire, would unite all the
conveniences, with all the magnificence, of situation.</P>

<P>Of other buildings, devoted to civil purposes, the CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES,
the HÔTEL DES INVALIDES, with its gilded dome (a little too profusely
adorned,) the INSTITUTE, and more particularly the MINT, are the chief
ornaments on the south side of the Seine. In these I am not disposed to
pick the least hole, by fastidious or hypercritical observations. Only I
wish that they would contrive to let the lions, in front of the façade of
the Institute, (sometimes called the <EM>Collège Mazarin</EM> or <EM>des
Quatre Nations</EM>--upon the whole, a magnificent pile) discharge a good
large mouthful of water--instead of the drivelling stream which is for
ever trickling from their closed jaws. Nothing can be more ridiculous than
the appearance of these meagre and unappropriate objects: the more to be
condemned, because the French in general assume great credit for the
management of their fountains. Of the four great buildings just noticed,
that of the Mint, or rather its façade, pleases me most. It is a beautiful
elevation, in pure good taste; but the stone is unfortunately of a coarse
grain and of a dingy colour. Of the BRIDGES thrown across the Seine,
connecting all the fine objects on either side, it must be allowed that
they are generally in good taste: light, yet firm; but those, in iron, of
Louis XVI. and <EM>des Arts</EM>, are perhaps to be preferred. The
<EM>Pont Neuf</EM>, where the ancient part of Paris begins, is a large,
long, clumsy piece of stone work: communicating with the island upon which
<EM>Notre Dame</EM> is built. But if you look eastward, towards old Paris,
from the top of this bridge--or if you look in the same direction, a
little towards the western side, or upon the quays,--you contemplate, in
my humble opinion, one of the grandest views of street scenery that can be
imagined! The houses are very lofty--occasionally of six or even eight
stories--the material with which they are built is a fine cream-coloured
stone: the two branches of the river, and the back ground afforded by
<EM>Notre Dame</EM>, and a few other subordinate public buildings,
altogether produce an effect- -especially as you turn your back upon the
sun, sinking low behind the <EM>Barrière de Neuilly</EM>--which would
equally warm the hearts and exercise the pencils of the TURNERS and
CALCOTS of our own shores. Indeed, I learn that the former distinguished
artist has actually made a drawing of this picture. But let me add, that
my own unqualified admiration had preceded the knowledge of this latter
fact. Among other buildings, I must put in a word of praise in behalf of
the HALLE-AUX-BLÉ'S--built after the model of the Pantheon at Rome. It is
one hundred and twenty French feet in diameter; has twenty-five covered
archways, or arcades, of ten feet in width; of which six are open, as
passages of ingress and egress-- corresponding with the like number of
opposite streets. The present cupola (preceded by one almost as large as
that of the Pantheon at Rome) is built of iron and brass--of a curious,
light, and yet sufficiently substantial construction--and is unassailable
by fire. I never passed through this building without seeing it well
stocked with provender; while its area was filled with farmers, who, like
our own, assemble to make the best bargain. Yet let me observe that, owing
to the height of the neighbouring houses, this building loses almost the
whole of its appropriate effect.</P>

<P>Nor should the EXCHANGE, in the <EM>Rue des Filles St. Thomas</EM>, be
dismissed without slight notice and commendation. It is equally simple,
magnificent, and striking: composed of a single row, or peristyle, of
Corinthian pillars, flanking a square of no mean dimensions, and
presenting fourteen pillars in its principal front. At this present
moment, it is not quite finished; but when completed, it promises to be
among the most splendid and the most perfect specimens of public
architecture in Paris.<A name="fnref_5"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_5">5</A> Beautiful as many may think <EM>our</EM> Exchange, in my
humble opinion it has no pretensions to compete with that at Paris. The
HÔTEL DE VILLE, near the <EM>Place de Grève</EM>, is rather in the
character of the more ancient buildings in France: it is exceedingly
picturesque, and presents a noble façade. Being situated amidst the older
streets of Paris, nothing can harmonise better with the surrounding
objects. Compared with the metropolis, on its present extended scale, it
is hardly of sufficient importance for the consequence usually attached to
this kind of building; but you must remember that the greater part of it
was built in the sixteenth century, when the capital had scarcely attained
half its present size. The <EM>Place de Grève</EM> during the Revolution,
was the spot in which the guillotine performed almost all its butcheries.
I walked over it with a hurrying step: fancying the earth to be yet moist
with the blood of so many immolated victims. Of other HÔTELS, I shall
mention only those of DE SENS and DE SOUBISE. The entrance into the former
yet exhibits a most picturesque specimen of the architecture of the early
part of the XVIth century. Its interior is devoted to every thing ...
which it ought <EM>not</EM> to be. The Hôtel de Soubise is still a
consequential building. It was sufficiently notorious during the reigns of
Charles V. and VI.: and it owes its present form to the enterprising
spirit of Cardinal Rohan, who purchased it of the Guise family towards the
end of the XVIIth century. There is now, neither pomp nor splendour, nor
revelry, within this vast building. All its aristocratic magnificence is
fled; but the antiquary and the man of curious research console themselves
on its possessing treasures of a more substantial and covetable kind. You
are to know that it contains the <EM>Archives of State</EM> and the
<EM>Royal Printing Office</EM>.</P>

<P>Paris has doubtless good reason to be proud of her public buildings;
for they are numerous, splendid, and commodious; and have the
extraordinary advantage over our own of not being tinted with soot and
smoke. Indeed, when one thinks of the sure invasion of every new stone or
brick building in London, by these enemies of external beauty, one is
almost sick at heart during the work of erection. The lower tier of
windows and columns round St. Paul's have been covered with the dirt and
smoke of upwards of a century: and the fillagree-like embellishments which
distinguish the recent restorations of Henry the VIIth's chapel, in
Westminster Abbey, are already beginning to lose their delicacy of
appearance from a similar cause. But I check myself. I am at Paris--and
not in the metropolis of our own country.</P>

<P>A word now for STREET SCENERY. Paris is perhaps here unrivalled: still
I speak under correction--having never seen Edinburgh. But, although
<EM>portions</EM> of that northern capital, from its undulating or hilly
site, must necessarily present more picturesque appearances, yet, upon the
whole, from the superior size of Paris, there must be more numerous
examples of the kind of scenery of which I am speaking. The specimens are
endless. I select only a few--the more familiar to me. In turning to the
left, from the <EM>Boulevard Montmartre</EM> or <EM>Poissonière</EM>, and
going towards the <EM>Rue St. Marc</EM>, or <EM>Rue des Filles St.
Thomas</EM> (as I have been in the habit of doing, almost every morning,
for the last ten days--in my way to the Royal Library) you leave the
<EM>Rue Montmartre</EM> obliquely to the left. The houses here seem to run
up to the sky; and appear to have been constructed with the same ease and
facility as children build houses of cards. In every direction about this
spot, the houses, built of stone, as they generally are, assume the most
imposing and picturesque forms; and if a Canaletti resided here, who would
condescend to paint without water and wherries, some really magnificent
specimens of this species of composition might be executed--equally to the
credit of the artist and the place.</P>

<P>If you want old fashioned houses, you must lounge in the long and
parallel streets of <EM>St. Denis</EM> and <EM>St. Martin</EM>; but be
sure that you choose dry weather for the excursion. Two hours of heavy
rain (as I once witnessed) would cause a little rushing rivulet in the
centre of these streets--and you could only pass from one side to the
other by means of a plank. The absence of <EM>trottoirs</EM>--- or
foot-pavement--is indeed here found to be a most grievous defect. With the
exception of the <EM>Place Vendome</EM> and the <EM>Rue de la Paix</EM>,
where something like this sort of pavement prevails, Paris presents you
with hardly any thing of the kind; so that, methinks, I hear you say,
"what though your Paris be gayer and more grand, our London is larger and
more commodious." Doubtless this is a fair criticism. But from the
<EM>Marché des Innocens</EM>--a considerable space, where they sell
chiefly fruit and vegetables,<A name="fnref_6"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_6">6</A>--(and which reminded me something of the market-places of
Rouen) towards the <EM>Hôtel de Ville</EM> and the <EM>Hôtel de
Soubise</EM>, you will meet with many extremely curious and interesting
specimens of house and street scenery: while, as I before observed to you,
the view of the houses and streets in the <EM>Isle St. Louis</EM>, from
the <EM>Pont des Ars</EM>, the <EM>Quai de Conti</EM>, the <EM>Pont
Neuf</EM>, or the <EM>Quai des Augustins</EM>--or, still better, the
<EM>Pont Royal</EM>--is absolutely one of the grandest and completest
specimens of metropolitan scenery which can be contemplated. Once more: go
as far as the <EM>Pont Louis XVI.</EM>, cast your eye down to the left;
and observe how magnificently the Seine is flanked by the Thuileries and
the Louvre. Surely, it is but a sense of justice and a love of truth which
compel an impartial observer to say, that this is a view of regal and
public splendor--without a parallel in our own country!</P>

<P>The <EM>Rue de Richelieu</EM> is called the Bond-street of Paris.
Parallel with it, is the <EM>Rue Vivienne</EM>. They are both pleasant
streets; especially the former, which is much longer, and is rendered more
striking by containing some of the finest hotels in Paris. Hosiers,
artificial flower makers, clock-makers, and jewellers, are the principal
tradesmen in the Rue de Richelieu; but it has no similarity with
Bond-street. The houses are of stone, and generally very lofty--while the
<EM>Academie de Musique</EM><A name="fnref_7"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_7">7</A> and the <EM>Bibliothèque du Roi</EM> are public buildings of
such consequence and capacity (especially the former) that it is absurd to
name the street in which they are situated with our own. The Rue Vivienne
is comparatively short; but it is pleasing, from the number of flowers,
shrubs, and fruits, brought thither from the public markets for sale. No
doubt the <EM>Place Vendome</EM> and the <EM>Rue de la Paix</EM> claim
precedence, on the score of magnificence and comfort, to either of these,
or to any other streets; but to my taste there is nothing (next to the
Boulevards) which is so thoroughly gratifying as the Rue de Richelieu. Is
it because some few hundred thousand <EM>printed volumes</EM> are
deposited therein? But of all these, the <EM>Rue St. Honoré</EM>, with its
faubourg so called, is doubtless the most distinguished and consequential.
It seems to run from west to east entirely through Paris; and is
considered, on the score of length, as more than a match for our Oxford
street.</P>

<P>It may be so; but if the houses are loftier, the street is much
narrower; and where, again, is your foot-pavement--to protect you from the
eternal movements of fiacre, cabriolet, voiture and diligence? Besides,
the undulating line of our Oxford-street presents, to the tasteful
observer, a sight--perfectly unrivalled of its kind--especially if it be
witnessed on a clear night, when its thousand gas-lighted lamps below
emulate the starry lustre of the heavens above! To an inexperienced eye,
this has the effect of enchantment. Add to the houses of Oxford-street but
two stories, and the appearance of this street, in the day time, would be
equally imposing: to which add--what can never be added--the atmosphere of
Paris!</P>

<P>You will remark that, all this time, I have been wholly silent about
the <EM>Palace de Luxembourg</EM>, with its beautiful though flat
gardens--of tulips, jonquils, roses, wall flowers, lilac and orange
trees--its broad and narrow walks--its terraces and statues. The façade,
in a line with the <EM>Rue Vaugirard</EM>, has a grand effect--in every
point of view. But the south front, facing the gardens, is extremely
beautiful and magnificent; while across the gardens, and in front,--some
short English mile--stands the OBSERVATORY. Yet fail not to visit the
interior square of the palace, for it is well worth your notice and
admiration. This building is now the <EM>Chambre des Pairs</EM>. Its most
celebrated ornament was the famous suite of paintings, by Rubens,
descriptive of the history of Henry IV. These now adorn the gallery of the
Louvre. It is a pity that this very tasteful structure--which seems to be
built of the choicest stone--should be so far removed from what may be
called the fashionable part of the city. It is in consequence reluctantly
visited by our countrymen; although a lover of botany, or a florist, will
not fail to procure two or three roots of the different species of
<EM>tulips</EM>, which, it is allowed, blow here in uncommon luxuriance
and splendor.</P>

<P>The preceding is, I am aware, but a feeble and partial sketch--compared
with what a longer residence, and a temperature more favourable to
exercise (for we are half scorched up with heat, positive and
reflected)--would enable me to make. But "where are my favourite
ECCLESIASTICAL EDIFICES?" methinks I hear you exclaim. Truly you shall
know as much as I know myself; which is probably little enough. Of
NOTRE-DAME, the west front, with its marygold window, is striking both
from its antiquity and richness. It is almost black from age; but the
alto-relievos, and especially those above the doors, stand out in almost
perfect condition. These ornaments are rather fine of their kind. There
is, throughout the whole of this west front, a beautiful keeping; and the
towers are, <EM>here</EM>, somewhat more endurable--and therefore somewhat
in harmony. Over the north-transept door, on the outside, is a figure of
the Virgin--once holding the infant Jesus in her arms. Of the latter, only
the feet remain. The drapery of this figure is in perfectly good taste: a
fine specimen of that excellent art which prevailed towards the end of the
XIIIth century. Above, is an alto-relievo subject of the slaughter of the
Innocents. The soldiers are in quilted armour. I entered the cathedral
from the western door, during service-time. A sight of the different
clergymen engaged in the office, filled me with melancholy--and made me
predict sad things of what was probably to come to pass! These clergymen
were old, feeble, wretchedly attired in their respective vestments--and
walked and sung in a tremulous and faltering manner. The architectural
effect in the interior is not very imposing: although the solid circular
pillars of the nave--the double aisles round the choir--and the old
basso-relievo representations of the life of Christ, upon the exterior of
the walls of the choir--cannot fail to afford an antiquary very singular
satisfaction. The choir appeared to be not unlike that of St. Denis.</P>

<P>The next Gothic church, in size and importance, is that of St.
GERVAIS-- situated to the left, in the Rue de Monceau. It has a very lofty
nave, but the interior is exceedingly flat and divested of ornament. The
pillars have scarcely any capitals. The choir is totally destitute of
effect. Some of the stained glass is rich and old, but a great deal has
been stolen or demolished during the Revolution. There is a good large
modern picture, in one of the side chapels to the right: and yet a more
modern one, much inferior, on the opposite side. In almost every side
chapel, and in the confessionals, the priests were busily engaged in the
catechetical examination of young people previous to the first Communion
on the following sabbath, which was the Fête-Dieu. The western front is
wholly Grecian--perhaps about two hundred years old. It is too lofty for
its width--but has a grand effect, and is justly much celebrated. Yet the
<EM>situation</EM> of this fine old Gothic church is among the most
wretched of those in Paris. It is preserved from suffocation, only by
holding it head so high. Next in importance to St. Gervais, is the Gothic
church of St. EUSTACHE: a perfect specimen, throughout, of that
adulterated style of Gothic architecture (called its
<EM>restoration!</EM>) which prevailed at the commencement of the reign of
Francis I. Faulty, and even meretricious, as is the whole of the interior,
the choir will not fail to strike you with surprise and gratification. It
is light, rich, and lofty. This church is very large, but not so capacious
as St. Gervais--while situation is, if possible, still more
objectionable.</P>

<P>Let me not forget my two old favourite churches of ST. GERMAIN DES
PRÈS, <EM>and St. Geneviève</EM>; although of the latter I hardly know
whether a hasty glimpse, both of the exterior and interior, be not
sufficient; the greater part having been destroyed during the
Revolution.<A name="fnref_8"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_8">8</A> The
immediate vicinity of the former is sadly choaked by stalls and shops--and
the west- front has been cruelly covered by modern appendages. It is the
church dearest to antiquaries; and with reason.<A name="fnref_9"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_9">9</A> I first visited it on a Sunday, when that
part of the Service was performed which required the fullest intonations
of the organ. The effect altogether was very striking. The singular
pillars-- of which the capitals are equally massive and grotesque, being
sometimes composed of human beings, and sometimes of birds and beasts,
especially towards the choir--the rising up and sitting down of the
congregation, and the yet more frequent movements of the priests--the
swinging of the censers--and the parade of the vergers, dressed in bag
wigs, with broad red sashes of silk, and silk stockings--but, above all,
the most scientifically touched, as well as the deepest and loudest toned,
organ I ever heard-- perfectly bewildered and amazed me! Upon the
dispersion of the congregation--which very shortly followed this religious
excitation--I had ample leisure to survey every part of this curious old
structure; which reminded me, although upon a much larger scale, of the
peculiarities of St. Georges de Bocherville, and Notre Dame at Guibray.
Certainly, very much of this church is of the twelfth century--and as I am
not writing to our friend P*** I will make bold to say that some portions
of it yet "smack strongly" of the eleventh.</P>

<P>Nearer to my residence, and of a kindred style of architecture, is the
church of ST. GERMAIN AUX AUXERROIS. The west front or porch is yet sound
and good. Nothing particularly strikes you on the entrance, but there are
some interesting specimens of rich old stained glass in the windows of the
transepts. The choir is completely and cruelly modernised. In the side
chapels are several good modern paintings; and over an altar of twisted
columns, round which ivy leaves, apparently composed of ivory, are
creeping, is a picture of three figures in the flames of purgatory. This
side-chapel is consecrated to the offering up of orisons "<EM>for the
souls in purgatory</EM>." It is gloomy and repulsive. Death's heads and
thigh bones are painted, in white colours, upon the stained wall; and in
the midst of all these fearful devices, I saw three young ladies intensely
occupied in their devotions at the railing facing the altar. Here again, I
observed priests examining young people in their catechism; and others in
confessionals, receiving the confessions of the young of both sexes,
previous to their taking the first sacrament on the approaching <EM>Fête-
Dieu</EM>.</P>

<P>Contiguous to the Sorbonne church, there stands, raising its neatly
constructed dome aloft in air, the <EM>Nouvelle Eglise Ste.
Geneviève</EM>, better known by the name of the PANTHEON. The interior
presents to my eye the most beautiful and perfect specimen of Grecian
architecture with which I am acquainted. In the crypt are seen the tombs
of French warriors; and upon the pavement above, is a white marble statue
of General Leclerc (brother in law of Bonaparte,) who died in the
expedition to St. Domingo. This, statue is too full of conceit and
affectation both in attitude and expression. The interior of the building
is about 370 English feet in length, by 270 in width; but it is said that
the foundation is too weak. From the gallery, running along the bottom of
the dome--the whole a miniature representation of our St. Paul's--you have
a sort of Panorama of Paris; but not, I think, a very favourable one. The
absence of sea-coal fume strikes you very agreeably; but, for picturesque
effect, I could not help thinking of the superior beauty of the panorama
of Rouen from the heights of Mont Ste. Catharine. It appears to me that
the small lantern on the top of the dome wants a finishing apex.<A name=
"fnref_10"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_10">10</A></P>

<P>Yonder majestic portico forms the west front of the church called St.
SULPICE ... It is at once airy and grand. There are two tiers of pillars,
of which this front is composed: the lower is Doric; the upper Ionic: and
each row, as I am told, is nearly forty French feet in height, exclusively
of their entablatures, each of ten feet. We have nothing like this,
certainly, as the front of a parish church, in London. When I except St.
Paul's, such exception is made in reference to the most majestic piece of
architectural composition, which, to my eye, the wit of man hath yet
devised. The architect of the magnificent front of St. Sulpice was
SERVANDONI; and a street hard by (in which Dom Brial, the father of French
history, resides) takes its name from this architect. There are two
towers- -one at each end of this front,--about two hundred and twenty feet
in height from the pavement: harmonising well with the general style of
architecture, but of which, that to the south (to the best of my
recollection) is left in an unaccountably, if not shamefully, unfinished
state.<A name="fnref_11"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_11">11</A> These
towers are said to be about one <EM>toise</EM> higher than those of Notre
Dame. The interior of this church is hardly less imposing than its
exterior. The vaulted roofs are exceedingly lofty; but for the length of
the nave, and more especially the choir, the transepts are
disproportionably short. Nor are there sufficiently prominent ornaments to
give relief to the massive appearance of the sides. These sides are
decorated by fluted pilasters of the Corinthian order; which, for so large
and lofty a building, have a tame effect. There is nothing like the huge,
single, insulated column, or the clustered slim pilasters, that separate
the nave from the side aisles of the Gothic churches of the early and
middle ages.</P>

<P>The principal altar, between the nave and the choir, is admired for its
size, and grandeur of effect; but it is certainly ill-placed, and is
perhaps too ornamental, looking like a detached piece which does not
harmonise with the surrounding objects. Indeed, most of the altars in
French churches want simplicity and appropriate effect: and the whole of
the interior of the choir is (perhaps to my fastidious eye only,)
destitute of that quiet solemn character, which ought always to belong to
places of worship. Rich, minute, and elaborate as are many of the Gothic
choirs of our own country, they are yet in harmony; and equally free from
a frivolous or unappropriate effect. Behind the choir, is the Chapel of
Our Lady: which is certainly both splendid and imposing. Upon the ceiling
is represented the Assumption of the Virgin, and the walls are covered
with a profusion of gilt ornament, which, upon the whole, has a very
striking effect. In a recess, above the altar, is a sculptured
representation of the Virgin and Infant Christ, in white marble, of a
remarkably high polish: nor are the countenances of the mother and child
divested of sweetness of expression. They are represented upon a large
globe, or with the world at their feet: upon the top of which, slightly
coiled, lies the "bruised" or dead serpent. The light, in front of the
spectator, from a concealed window, (a contrivance to which the French
seem partial) produces a sort of magical effect. I should add, that this
is the largest parochial church in Paris; and that its organ has been
pronounced to be matchless.</P>

<P>The rival churches of St. Sulpice--rival ones, rather from similarity
of structure, than extent of dimensions--are the ORATOIRE and St. ROCH:
both situated in the Rue St. Honoré. St. Roch is doubtless a very fine
building- -with a well-proportioned front--and a noble flight of steps;
but the interior is too plain and severe for my taste. The walls are
decorated by unfluted pilasters, with capitals scarcely conformable to any
one order of architecture. The choir however is lofty, and behind it, in
Our Lady's Chapel if I remember rightly, there is a striking piece of
sculpture, of the Crucifixion, sunk into a rock, which receives the light
from an invisible aperture as at St. Sulpice. To the right, or rather
behind this chapel, there is another--called the <EM>Chapel of
Calvary</EM>,--in which you observe a celebrated piece of sculpture, of
rather colossal dimensions, of the entombment of Christ. The dead Saviour
is borne to the sepulchre by Joseph of Arimathea, St. John, and the three
Maries. The name of the sculptor is <EM>Deseine</EM>. Certainly you cannot
but be struck with the effect of such representations--which accounts for
these two chapels being a great deal more attended, than the choir or the
nave of the church. It is right however to add, that the pictures here are
preferable to those at St. Sulpice: and the series of bas-reliefs,
descriptive of the principal events in the life of Christ, is among the
very best specimens of art, of that species, which Paris can boast of.</P>

<P>Very different from either of these interiors is that of <EM>St.
Philippe du Roule</EM>; which presents you with a single insulated row of
fluted Ionic pillars, on each side of the nave; very airy, yet impressive
and imposing. It is much to my taste; and I wish such a plan were more
generally adopted in the interiors of Grecian-constructed churches. The
choir, the altar ... the whole is extremely simple and elegant. Nor must
the roof be omitted to be particularly mentioned. It is an arch,
constructed of wood; upon a plan originally invented by Philibert
Delorme-- so well known in the annals of art in the sixteenth century. The
whole is painted in stone colour, and may deceive the most experienced
eye. This beautiful church was built after the designs of Chalgrin, about
the year 1700; and is considered to be a purer resemblance of the antique
than any other in Paris. This church, well worth your examination, is
situated in a quarter rarely visited by our countrymen--in the <EM>Rue du
Faubourg du Roule</EM>, not far from the barriers.</P>

<P>Not very remotely connected with the topic of CHURCHES, is that of the
SABBATHS ... as spent in Paris. They are nearly the same throughout all
France. As Bonaparte had no respect for religion itself, so he had less
for the forms connected with the upholding of it. Parades, battles, and
campaigns--were all that he cared about: and the Parisians, if they
supplied him with men and money--the <EM>materiel</EM> for the execution
of these objects--were left to pray, preach, dance, or work, just as they
pleased on the Sabbath day. The present King,<A name="fnref_12"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_12">12</A> as you well know, attempted the
introduction of something like an <EM>English Sabbath</EM>: but it would
not do. When the French read and understand GRAHAME<A name=
"fnref_13"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_13">13</A> as well as they do
THOMSON, they will peradventure lend a ready and helping hand towards the
completion of this laudable plan. At present, there is much which hurts
the eye and ear of a well-educated and well-principled Englishman. There
is a partial shutting up of the shops before twelve; but after mid-day the
shop-windows are uniformly closed throughout Paris. Meanwhile the cart,
the cabriolet, the crier of herbs and of other marketable produce--the
sound of the whip or of the carpenter's saw and hammer--the shelling of
peas in the open air, and the plentiful strewing of the pod hard
by--together with sundry, other offensive and littering
accompaniments--all strike you as disagreeable deviations from what you
have been accustomed to witness at home. Add to this, the half-dirty
attire--the unshaven beard of the men, and the unkempt locks of the
women--produce further revolting sensations. It is not till past mid-day
that the noise of labour ceases, and that the toilette is put into a
complete state for the captivation of the beholder. By four or five
o'clock the streets become half thinned. On a Sunday, every body rushes
into the country. The tradesman has his little villa, and the gentleman
and man of fortune his more capacious rural domain; and those, who aspire
neither to the one or the other, resort to the <EM>Bois de Boulogne</EM>
and the <EM>Champs Elysées</EM>, or to the gardens of <EM>Beaujon</EM>,
and <EM>Tivoli</EM>--or to the yet more attractive magnificence of the
palace and fountains of <EM>Versailles</EM>--where, in one or the other of
these places, they carouse, or disport themselves--in promenades, or
dancing groups-- till</P>

<P class="poetry">... Majores.. cadunt de montibus umbræ.</P>

<P>This, generally and fairly speaking, is a summer Sabbath in the
metropolis of France.</P>

<P>Unconscionable as you may have deemed the length of this epistle, I
must nevertheless extend it by the mention of what I conceive to be a very
essential feature both of beauty and utility in the street scenery of
Paris. It is of the FOUNTAINS that I am now about to speak; and of some of
which a slight mention has been already made. I yet adhere to the
preference given to that in the <EM>Palais Royal</EM>; considered with
reference to the management of the water. It is indeed a purely aqueous
exhibition, in which architecture and sculpture have nothing to do. Not so
are the more imposing fountains of the MARCHÉ DES INNOCENS, DE GRENELLE,
and the BOULEVARD BONDY. For the first of these,<A name="fnref_14"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_14">14</A> the celebrated <EM>Lescot</EM>, abbé de
Clagny, was the designer of the general form; and the more celebrated Jean
Goujon the sculptor of the figures in bas-relief. It was re-touched and
perfected in 1551, and originally stood in the angle of the two streets,
of <EM>aux Fers</EM> and <EM>St. Denis</EM>, presenting only two façades
to the beholder. It was restored and beautified in 1708; and in 1788 it
changed both its form and its position by being transported to the present
spot--the <EM>Marché des Innocens</EM>--the market for vegetables. Two
other similar sides were then added, making it a square: but the original
performances of Goujon, which are considered almost as his master-piece,
attract infinitely more admiration than the more recent ones of Pajou.
Goujon's figures are doubtless very delicately and successfully executed.
The water bubbles up in the centre of the square, beneath the arch, in
small sheets, or masses; and its first and second subsequent falls, also
in sheets, have a very beautiful effect. They are like pieces of thin,
transparent ice, tumbling upon each other; but the <EM>lead</EM>, of which
the lower half of the fountain is composed--as the reservoir of the
water--might have been advantageously exchanged for <EM>marble</EM>. The
lion at each corner of the pedestal, squirting water into a
sarcophagus-shaped reservoir, has a very absurd appearance. Upon the
whole, this fountain is well deserving of particular attention. The
inscription upon it is FONTIVM NYMPHIS; but perhaps, critically speaking,
it is now in too exposed a situation for the character of it's ornaments.
A retired, rural, umbrageous recess, beneath larch and pine--whose
boughs</P>

<P class="poetry">Wave high and murmur in the hollow wind--</P>

<P>seems to be the kind of position fitted for the reception of a fountain
of this character.</P>

<P>The FONTAINE DE GRENELLE is almost entirely architectural; and gives an
idea of a public office, rather than of a conduit. You look above--to the
right and the left--but no water appears. At last, almost by accident, you
look down, quite at its base, and observe two insignificant streams
trickling from the head of an animal. The central figure in front is a
representation of the city of Paris: the recumbent figures, on each side,
represent, the one the Seine, the other the Marne. Above, there are four
figures which represent the four Seasons. This fountain, the work of
Bouchardon, was erected in 1739 upon the site of what formed a part of an
old convent. A more simple, and a more striking fountain, to my taste, is
that of the ECOLE DE CHIRURGIE; in which a comparatively large column of
water rushes down precipitously between two Doric pillars--which form the
central ones of four--in an elegant façade.</P>

<P>Yet more simple, more graceful, and more capacious, is the fountain of
the BOULEVARD BONDY--which I first saw sparkling beneath the lustre of a
full moon. This is, in every sense of the word, a fountain. A constant but
gentle undulation of water, from three aqueous terraces, surmounted by
three basins, gradually diminishing in size, strike you with peculiar
gratification--view it from whatever quarter you will: but seen in the
neighbourhood of <EM>trees</EM>, the effect, in weather like this, is
absolutely heart-refreshing. The only objectionable part of this elegant
structure, on the score of art, are the lions, and their positions. In the
first place, it is difficult to comprehend why the mouth of a
<EM>lion</EM> is introduced as a channel for the transmission of water;
and, in the second place, these lions should have occupied the basement
portion of the structure. This beautiful fountain, of which the water is
supplied by the <EM>Canal d'Ourcq</EM>, was finished only about seven or
eight years ago. Nor let the FOUNTAIN OF TRIUMPH or VICTORY, in the
<EM>Place du Châtelet</EM>, be forgotten. It is a column, surmounted by a
gilt statue of Victory, with four figures towards its pedestal. The four
jets-d'eau, from its base,--which are sufficiently insignificant--empty
themselves into a circular basin; but the shaft of the column, to my eye,
is not free from affectation. The names of some of Bonaparte's principal
victories are inscribed upon that part of the column which faces the Pont
au Change. There is a classical air of elegance about this fountain, which
is fifty feet in height.</P>

<P>But where is the ELEPHANT Fountain?--methinks I hear you exclaim. It is
yet little more than in embryo: that is to say, the plaster-cast of it
only is visible--with the model, on a smaller scale, completed in all its
parts, by the side of it. It is really a stupendous affair.<A name=
"fnref_15"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_15">15</A> On entering the
temporary shed erected for its construction, on the site of the Bastille,
I was almost breathless with astonishment for a moment. Imagine an
enormous figure of the unwieldy elephant, <EM>full fifty feet high!</EM>
You see it, in the front, foreshortened--as you enter; and as the head is
the bulkiest portion of the animal, you may imagine something of the
probable resulting effect. Certainly it is most imposing. The visitor, who
wishes to make himself acquainted with the older, and more original,
national character of the French--whether as respects manners, dresses,
domestic occupations, and public places of resort--will take up his
residence in the <EM>Rue du Bac</EM>, or at the <EM>Hotel des
Bourbons</EM>; within twenty minutes walk of the more curious objects
which are to be found in the Quartiers Saint André des Arcs, du
Luxembourg, and Saint Germain des Près. Ere he commence his morning
perambulations, he will look well at his map, and to what is described, in
the route which he is to take, in the works of Landon and of Legrand, or
of other equally accurate topographers. Two things he ought invariably to
bear in mind: the first, not to undertake too much, for the sake of saying
how <EM>many</EM> things he has seen:--and the second, to make himself
thoroughly master of what he <EM>does</EM> see. All this is very easily
accomplished: and a fare of thirty sous will take you, at starting, to
almost any part of Paris, however remote: from whence you may shape your
course homewards at leisure, and with little fatigue. Such a visitor will,
however, sigh, ere he set out on his journey, on being told that the old
Gothic church of <EM>St. André-des-Arcs</EM>--the Abbey of <EM>St.
Victor</EM> --the churches of the <EM>Bernardins</EM>, and of <EM>St.
Etienne des Près</EM>, the <EM>Cloisters</EM> of <EM>the Cordeliers</EM>,
and the <EM>Convent of the Celestins</EM> ... exist no longer ... or, that
their remains are mere shadows of shades! But in the three quarters of
Paris, above mentioned, he will gather much curious information--in spite
of the havoc and waste which the Revolution has made; and on his return to
his own country he will reflect, with pride and satisfaction, on the
result of his enterprise and perseverance.</P>

<P>To my whimsically formed taste, OLD PARIS has in it very much to
delight, and afford valuable information. Not that I would decry the
absolute splendor, gaiety, comfort, and interminable variety, which
prevail in its more modern and fashionable quarters. And certainly one may
fairly say, that, on either side the Seine, Paris is a city in which an
Englishman,--who is resolved to be in good humour with all about him, and
to shew that civility to others which he is sure to receive from the
better educated classes of society here--cannot fail to find himself
pleased, perfectly at ease, and well contented with his fare. Compared
with the older part of London, the more ancient division of Paris is
infinitely more interesting, and of a finer architectural construction.
The conical roofs every now and then remind you of the times of Francis
I.; and the clustered arabesques, upon pilasters, or running between the
bolder projections of the façades, confirm you in the chronology of the
buildings. But time, caprice, fashion, or poverty, will, in less than half
a century, materially change both the substance and surfaces of things. It
is here, as at Rouen-- you bewail the work of destruction which has
oftentimes converted cloisters into workshops, and consecrated edifices
into warehouses of every description. Human nature and the fate of human
works are every where the same. Let two more centuries revolve, and the
THUILERIES and the LOUVRE may possibly be as the BASTILLE and the
TEMPLE.</P>

<P>Such, to my feelings, is Paris--considered only with reference to its
<EM>local</EM>: for I have really done little more than perambulate its
streets, and survey its house-tops--with the important exceptions to be
detailed in the succeeding letters from hence. Of the treasures contained
<EM>beneath</EM> some of those "housetops"--more especially of such as are
found in the shape of a BOOK--whether as a MS. or a Printed
Volume--prepare to receive some particulars in my next.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER II.</H3>

<P>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE BIBLIOTHÈQUE DU ROI. THE LIBRARIANS.</P>

<P><EM>Hôtel des Colonies, Rue de Richelieu</EM>.</P>

<P>The moment is at length arrived when you are to receive from me an
account of some of the principal treasures contained in the ROYAL LIBRARY
of Paris. I say "<EM>some</EM>":--because, in an epistolary communication,
consistently with my time, and general objects of research--it must be
considered only as a slight selection, compared with what a longer
residence, and a more general examination of the contents of such a
collection, might furnish. Yet, limited as my view may have been, the
objects of that view are at once rich and rare, and likely to afford all
true sons of BIBLIOMANIA and VIRTU the most lively gratification. This is
a bold avowal: but I fear not to make it, and: the sequel shall be the
test of its modesty and truth.</P>

<P>You observe, I have dated my letter from a different quarter. In fact,
the distance of my former residence from the Bibliothèque du Roi--coupled
with the oppressive heat of the weather--rendered my morning excursions
thither rather uncomfortable; and instead of going to work with elastic
spirits, and an untired frame, both Mr. Lewis and myself felt jaded and
oppressed upon our arrival. We are now, on the contrary, scarcely fifty
yards from the grand door of entrance into the library. But this is only
tantalizing you. To the LIBRARY, therefore, at once let us go. The
exterior and interior, as to architectural appearance, are rather of a
sorry description: heavy; comparatively low, without ornament, and of a
dark and dingy tint. Towards the street, it has the melancholy air of a
workhouse. But none of the apartments, in which the books are contained,
look into this street; so that, consequently, little inconvenience is
experienced from the incessant motion and rattling of carts and
carriages--the Rue de Richelieu being probably the most frequented in
Paris. Yet, repulsive as may be this exterior, it was observed to me--on
my suggesting what a fine situation the quadrangle of the Louvre would
make for the reception of the royal library--that, it might be questioned
whether even <EM>that</EM> quadrangle were large enough to contain
it;--and that the present building, however heavy and ungracious of
aspect, was better calculated for its present purpose than probably any
other in Paris. In the centre of the edifice--for it is a square, or
rather a parallelogram-shaped building-- stands a bronze naked figure of
Diana; stiff and meagre both in design and execution. It is of the size of
life; but surely a statue of <EM>Minerva</EM> would have been a little
more appropriate? On entering the principal door, in the street just
mentioned, you turn to the right, and mount a large stone staircase--after
attending to the request, printed in large characters, of "<EM>Essuyez vos
Souliers</EM>"--as fixed against the wall. This entrance goes directly to
the collection of PRINTED BOOKS. On reaching the first floor, you go
straight forward, within folding doors; and the first room, of
considerable extent, immediately receives you. The light is uniformly
admitted by large windows, to the right, looking into the quadrangle
before mentioned.</P>

<P>You pass through this room--where scarcely any body lingers--and enter
the second, where are placed the EDITIONES PRINCIPES, and other volumes
printed in the fifteenth century. To an <EM>experienced</EM> eye, the
first view of the contents of this second room is absolutely magical; Such
copies of such rare, precious, magnificent, and long-sought after
impressions!... It is fairy-land throughout. There stands the <EM>first
Homer</EM>, unshorn by the binder; a little above, is the first <EM>Roman
edition of Eustathius's</EM> Commentary upon that poet, in gorgeous red
morocco, but printed UPON VELLUM! A Budæus <EM>Greek Lexicon</EM> (Francis
I.'s own copy) also UPON VELLUM! The <EM>Virgils, Ovids, Plinies</EM> ...
and, above all, the <EM>Bibles</EM>--But I check myself; in order to
conduct you regularly through the apartments, ere you sit down with me
before each volume which I may open. In this second-room are two small
tables, rarely occupied, but at one or the other of which I was stationed
(by the kind offices of M. Van Praet) for fourteen days--with almost every
thing that was exquisite and rare, in the old book-way, behind and before
me. Let us however gradually move onwards. You pass into the third room.
Here is the grand rendezvous of readers. Six circular or rather oval
tables, each capable of accommodating twelve students, and each generally
occupied by the full number, strike your eye in a very pleasing manner, in
the centre of this apparently interminable vista of printed volumes.</P>

<P>But I must call your particular attention to the <EM>foreground</EM> of
this magical book-view. To the left of this third room, on entering, you
observe a well-dressed Gentleman (of somewhat shorter stature than the
author of this description) busied behind a table; taking down and putting
up volumes: inscribing names, and numbers, and titles, in a large folio
volume; giving orders on all sides; and putting several pairs of legs into
motion in consequence of those orders--while his own are perhaps the least
spared of any. This gentleman is no less a personage than the celebrated
Monsieur VAN PRAET; one of the chief librarians in the department of the
printed books. His aspect is mild and pleasant; while his smart attire
frequently forms a striking contrast to habiliments and personal
appearances of a very different, and less conciliating description, by
which he is surrounded.<A name="fnref_16"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_16">16</A> M. Van Praet must be now approaching his sixtieth year;
but his age sits bravely upon him--for his step is rapid and firm, and his
physiognomical expression indicative of a much less protracted period of
existence.<A name="fnref_17"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_17">17</A> He
is a Fleming by birth; and, even in shewing his first Eustathius, or first
Pliny, UPON VELLUM, you may observe the natural enthusiasm of a Frenchman
tempered by the graver emotions of a native of the Netherlands.</P>

<P>This distinguished Bibliographer (of whom, somewhat more in a future
epistle) has now continued nearly forty years in his present situation;
and when infirmity, or other causes, shall compel him to quit it, France
will never replace him by one possessing more appropriate talents! He
doats upon the objects committed to his trust. He lives almost entirely
among his dear books ... either on the first floor or on the ground floor:
for when the hour of departure, two o'clock, arrives, M. Van Praet betakes
him to the quieter book realms below--where, surrounded by <EM>Grolier, De
Thou</EM>, and <EM>Diane de Poictiers</EM>, copies, he disports him till
his dinner hour of four or five--and 'as the evening shades prevail,' away
hies he to his favourite '<EM>Théatre des Italiens</EM>,' and the
scientific treat of Italian music. This I know, however--and this I will
say--in regard to the amiable and excellent gentleman under
description--that, if I were King of France, Mons. Van Praet should be
desired to sit in a roomy, morocco- bottomed, mahogany arm chair--not to
stir therefrom--but to issue out his edicts, for the delivery of books, to
the several athletic myrmidons under his command. Of course there must be
occasional exceptions to this rigid, but upon the whole salutary,
"Ordonnance du Roy." Indeed I have reason to mention a most flattering
exception to it--in my own favour: for M. Van Praet would come into the
second room, (just mentioned) and with his own hands supply me with half a
score volumes at a time--of such as I wished to examine. But, generally
speaking, this worthy and obliging creature is too lavish of his own
personal exertions. He knows, to be sure, all the bye- passes, and abrupt
ascents and descents; and if he be out of sight--in a moment, through some
secret aperture, he returns as quickly through another equally unseen
passage. Upon an average, I set his bibliomaniacal peregrinations down at
the rate of a full French league per day. It is the absence of all
pretension and quackery--the quiet, unobtrusive manner in which he opens
his well-charged battery of information upon you--but, more than all, the
glorious honours which are due to him, for having assisted to rescue the
book treasures of the Abbey of St. Germain des Près from destruction,
during the horrors of the Revolution--that cannot fail to secure to him
the esteem of the living, and the gratitude of posterity.</P>

"GOLD MEDAL OF LOUIS XII. From the Cabinet des Medailles at Paris.">

<P class="centered">GOLD MEDAL OF LOUIS XII.<BR>
From the Cabinet des Medailles at Paris.</P>
</DIV>

<P>We must now leave this well occupied and richly furnished chamber, and
pass on to the fourth room--in the centre of which is a large raised
bronze ornament, representing Apollo and the Muses--surrounded by the more
eminent literary characters of France in the seventeenth century. It is
raised to the glory of the grand monarque Louis XIV. and the figure of
Apollo is intended for that of his Majesty. The whole is a palpable
failure: a glaring exhibition of bad French taste. Pegasus, the Muses,
rocks, and streams, are all scattered about in a very confused manner;
without connection, and of course without effect. Even the French allow it
to be "mesquin, et de mauvais goût." But let me be methodical. As you
enter this fourth room, you observe, opposite--before you turn to the
right--a door, having the inscription of CABINET DES MEDAILLES. This door
however is open only twice in the week; when the cabinet is freely and
most conveniently shewn. Of its contents--in part, precious beyond
comparison--this is the place to say only one little word or two: for
really there would be no end of detail were I to describe even its most
remarkable treasures. Francis I. and his son Henry II. were among its
earliest patrons; when the cabinet was deposited in the Louvre. The former
enriched it with a series of valuable gold medals, and among them with one
of Louis XII., his predecessor; which has not only the distinction of
being beautifully executed, but of being the largest, if not the first of
its kind in France.<A name="fnref_18"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_18">18</A></P>

<P>The specimens of Greek art, in coins, and other small productions, are
equally precious and select. Vases, shields, gems, and cameos--the greater
part of which are described in Caylus's well-known work--are perfectly
enchanting. But the famous AGAT of the STE. CHAPELLE--supposed to be the
largest in the world, and which has been engraved by Giradet in a manner
perfectly unrivalled--will not fail to rivet your attention, and claim
your most unqualified commendation. The sardonyx, called the VASE of
PTOLEMY, is another of the great objects of attraction in the room where
we are now tarrying--and beautiful, and curious, and precious, it
unquestionably is. Doubtless, in such a chamber as this, the classical
archæologist will gaze with no ordinary emotions, and meditate with no
ordinary satisfaction. But I think I hear the wish escape him--as he casts
an attentive eye over the whole--"why do they not imitate us in a
publication relating to them? Why do they not put forth something similar
to what we have done for our <EM>Museum Marbles</EM>? Or rather, speaking
more correctly, why are not the <EM>Marlborough Gems</EM> considered as an
object of rivalry, by the curators of this exquisite cabinet? Paris is not
wanting both in artists who design, and who engrave, in this department,
with at least equal skill to our own."<A name="fnref_19"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_19">19</A></P>

<P>Let us now return to the Books. In the fourth book-room there is an
opening in the centre, to the left, nearly facing the bronze ornament--
through which, as you enter, and look to the left, appear the upper halves
of two enormous GLOBES. The effect is at first, inconceivably puzzling and
even startling: but you advance, and looking down the huge aperture
occasioned by these gigantic globes, you observe their bases resting on
the ground floor: both the upper and ground floor having the wainscots
entirely covered by books. These globes are the performance of Vincent
Coronelli, a Venetian; and were presented to Louis XIV. by the Cardinal
d'Etrées, who had them made for his Majesty. You return back into the
fourth room--pace on to its extremity, and then, at right angles, view the
fifth room--or, comprising the upper and lower globe rooms, a seventh
room; the whole admirably well lighted up from large side windows. Observe
further--the whole corresponding suite of rooms, on the ground floor, is
also nearly filled with printed books, comprising the <EM>unbound
copies</EM>--and one chamber, occupied by the more exquisite specimens of
the presses of the <EM>Alduses</EM>, the <EM>Giuntæ</EM>, the
<EM>Stephens</EM>, &amp;c. UPON VELLUM, or on <EM>large paper</EM>.
Another chamber is exclusively devoted to large paper copies of
<EM>all</EM> descriptions, from the presses of all countries; and in one
or the other of these chambers are deposited the volumes from the Library
of <EM>Grolier</EM> and <EM>De Thou</EM>--names, dear to Book- Collectors;
as an indifferent copy has hardly ever yet been found which was once
deposited on the shelves of either. You should know that the public do not
visit this lower suite of rooms, it being open only to the particular
friends of the several Librarians. The measurement of these rooms, from
the entrance to the extremity of the fifth room, is upwards of 700
feet.</P>

<P>Now, my good friend, if you ask me whether the interior of this library
be superior to that of our dear BODLEIAN, I answer, at once, and without
fear of contradiction--it is very much <EM>inferior</EM>. It represents an
interminable range of homely and commodious apartments; but the Bodleian
library, from beginning to end--from floor to ceiling--is grand,
impressive, and entirely of a bookish appearance. In that spacious and
lofty receptacle--of which the ceiling, in my humble opinion, is an unique
and beautiful piece of workmanship--all is solemn, and grave, and inviting
to study: yet echoing, as it were, to the footsteps of those who once
meditated within its almost hallowed precincts--the <EM>Bodleys</EM>, the
<EM>Seldens</EM>, the <EM>Digbys</EM>, the <EM>Lauds</EM> and
<EM>Tanners</EM>, of other times!<A name="fnref_20"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_20">20</A> But I am dreaming: forgetting that, at this moment,
you are impatient to enter the <EM>MS. Department</EM> of the Royal
Library at Paris. Be it so, therefore. And yet the very approach to this
invaluable collection is difficult of discovery. Instead of a
corresponding lofty stone stair-case, you cross a corner of the square,
and enter a passage, with an iron gate at the extremity--leading to the
apartments of Messrs. Millin and Langlès. A narrow staircase, to the
right, receives you: and this stair-case would appear to lead rather to an
old armoury, in a corner-tower of some baronial castle, than to a suite of
large modern apartments, containing probably, upon the whole, the finest
collection of <EM>Engravings</EM> and of <EM>Manuscripts</EM>, of all ages
and characters, in Europe. Nevertheless, as we cannot mount by any other
means, we will e'en set footing upon this stair-case, humble and obscure
as it may be. You scarcely gain the height of some twenty steps, when you
observe the magical inscription of CABINET DES ESTAMPES. Your spirits
dance, and your eyes sparkle, as you pull the little wire--and hear the
clink of a small corresponding bell. The door is opened by one of the
attendants in livery--arrayed in blue and silver and red--very handsome,
and rendered more attractive by the respectful behaviour of those who wear
that royal costume. I forgot to say that the same kind of attendants are
found in all the apartments attached to this magnificent collection--and,
when not occupied in their particular vocation of carrying books to and
fro, these attendants are engaged in reading, or sitting quietly with
crossed legs, and peradventure dosing a little. But nothing can exceed
their civility; accompanied with a certain air of politeness, not
altogether divested of a kind of gentlemanly deportment.</P>

<P>On entering the first of those rooms, where the prints are kept, you
are immediately struck with the narrow dimensions of the place--for the
succeeding room, though perhaps more than twice as large, is still
inadequate to the reception of its numerous visitors.<A name=
"fnref_21"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_21">21</A> In this first room
you observe a few of the very choicest productions of the burin, from the
earliest periods of the art, to the more recent performances of
<EM>Desnoyer</EM>, displayed within glazed frames upon the wainscot. It
really makes the heart of a connoisseur leap with ecstacy to see such
<EM>Finiguerras, Baldinis, Boticellis, Mantegnas, Pollaiuolos, Israel Van
Meckens, Albert Durers, Marc Antonios, Rembrandts, Hollar, Nanteuils,
Edelincks, &amp;c.</EM>; while specimens of our own great master
engravers, among whom are <EM>Woollet</EM> and <EM>Sharp</EM>, maintain a
conspicuous situation, and add to the gratification of the beholder. The
idea is a good one; but to carry it into complete effect, there should be
a gallery, fifty feet long, of a confined width, and lighted from above:<A
name="fnref_22"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_22">22</A> whereas the
present room is scarcely twenty feet square, with a disproportionably low
ceiling. However, you cannot fail to be highly gratified--and onwards you
go--diagonally--and find yourself in a comparatively long room--in the
midst of which is a table, reaching from nearly one end to the other, and
entirely filled (every day) with visitors, or rather students--busied each
in their several pursuits. Some are quietly turning over the succeeding
leaves, on which the prints are pasted: others are pausing upon each fine
specimen, in silent ecstacy--checking themselves every instant lest they
should break forth into rapturous exclamations!... "silence" being rigidly
prescribed by the Curators--and, I must say, as rigidly maintained. Others
again are busied in deep critical examination of some ancient ruin from
the pages of <EM>Piranesi</EM> or of <EM>Montfaucon</EM>--now making
notes, and now copying particular parts. Meanwhile, from the top to the
bottom of the sides of the, room, are huge volumes of prints, bound in red
morocco; which form indeed the materials for the occupations just
described.<A name="fnref_23"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_23">23</A></P>

<P>But, hanging upon a pillar, at the hither end of this second room, you
observe a large old drawing of a head or portrait, in a glazed frame;
which strikes you in every respect as a great curiosity. M. Du Chesne, the
obliging and able director of this department of the collection, attended
me on my first visit. He saw me looking at this head with great eagerness.
"Enfin voilà quelque chose qui mérite bien vôtre attention"--observed he.
It was in fact the portrait of "their good but unfortunate KING JOHN"--as
my guide designated him. This Drawing is executed in a sort of thick body
colour, upon fine linen: the back-ground is gold: now almost entirely
tarnished--and there is a sort of frame, stamped, or pricked out, upon the
surface of the gold--as we see in the illuminations of books of that
period. It should also seem as if the first layer, upon which the gold is
placed, had been composed of the white of an egg--or of some such
glutinous substance. Upon the whole, it is an exceedingly curious and
interesting relic of antient graphic art.</P>

<P>To examine minutely the treasures of such a collection of prints--
whether in regard to ancient or modern art--would demand the unremitted
attention of the better part of a month; and in consequence, a
proportionate quantity of time and paper in embodying the fruits of that
attention.<A name="fnref_24"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_24">24</A>
There is only one other curiosity, just now, to which I shall call your
attention. It is the old wood cut of ST. CHRISTOPHER--of which certain
authors have discoursed largely.<A name="fnref_25"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_25">25</A> They suppose they have an impression of it here--
whereas that of Lord Spencer has been hitherto considered as unique. His
Lordship's copy, as you well know, was obtained from the Buxheim
monastery, and was first made public in the interesting work of
Heineken.<A name="fnref_26"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_26">26</A> The
copy now under consideration is not pasted upon boards, as is Lord
Spencer's-- forming the interior linings in the cover or binding of an old
MS.--but it is a loose leaf, and is therefore subject to the most minute
examination, or to any conclusion respecting the date which may be drawn
from the <EM>watermark</EM>. Upon <EM>such</EM> a foundation I will never
attempt to build an hypothesis, or to draw a conclusion; because the same
water-mark of Bamberg and of Mentz, of Venice and of Rome, may be found
within books printed both at the commencement and at the end of the
fifteenth century. But for the print--as it <EM>is</EM>. I have not only
examined it carefully, but have procured, from M. Coeuré, a fac-simile of
the head only--the most essential part--and both the examination and the
fac-simile convince me... that the St. Christopher in the Bibliothèque du
Roi is NOT an impression from the <EM>same block</EM> which furnished the
St. Christopher now in the library of St. James's Place.</P>

<P>The general character of the figure, in the Royal Library here, is thin
and feeble compared with that in Lord Spencer's collection; and I am quite
persuaded that M. Du Chesne,--who fights his ground inch by inch, and
reluctantly (to his honour, let me add) assents to any remarks which may
make his own cherished St. Christopher of a comparatively modern date--
will, in the end, admit that the Parisian impression is a <EM>copy</EM> of
a later date--and that, had an opportunity presented itself of comparing
the two impressions with each other,<A name="fnref_27"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_27">27</A> it would never have been received into the
Library at the price at which it was obtained--I think, at about 620
francs. However, although it be not THE St. Christopher, it is a graphic
representation of the Saint which may possibly be as old as the year
1460.</P>

<P>But we have tarried quite long enough, for the present, within the
cabinet of Engravings. Let us return: ascend about a dozen more steps; and
enter the LIBRARY OF MANUSCRIPTS. As before, you are struck with the
smallness of the first room; which leads, however, to a second of much
larger dimensions--then to a third, of a boudoir character; afterwards to
a fourth and fifth, rather straitened--and sixthly, and lastly, to one of
a noble length and elevation of ceiling--worthy in all respects of the
glorious treasures which it contains. Let me, however, be more explicit.
In the very first room you have an earnest of all the bibliomaniacal
felicity which these MSS. hold out. Look to the left--upon entering--and
view, perhaps lost in a very ecstacy of admiration--the
<STRONG>Romances</STRONG> ... of all sizes and character, which at first
strike you! What <EM>Launcelot du Lacs, Tristans, Leonnois, Arturs,
Ysaises</EM>, and feats of the <EM>Table Ronde</EM>, stand closely wedged
within the brass-wired doors that incircle this and every other apartment!
<EM>Bibles, Rituals, Moralities</EM>, ... next claim your attention. You
go on--<EM>History, Philosophy, Arts and Sciences</EM> ... but it is
useless to indulge in these rhapsodies. The fourth apartment, of which I
spake, exhibits specimens of what are seen more plentifully, but not of
more curious workmanship, in the larger room to which it leads. Here
glitter, behind glazed doors, old volumes of devotion bound in ivory, or
gilt, or brass, studded with cameos and precious stones; and covered with
figures of all characters and ages--some of the XIIth--and more of the
immediately following centuries. Some of these bindings (among which I
include <EM>Diptychs</EM>) may be as old as the eleventh--and they have
been even carried up to the tenth century.</P>

<P>Let us however return quickly back again; and begin at the beginning.
The first room, as I before observed, has some of the most exquisitely
illuminated, as well as some of the most ancient MSS., in the whole
library. A phalanx of <EM>Romances</EM> meets the eye; which rather
provokes the courage, than damps the ardor, of the bibliographical
champion. Nor are the illuminated <EM>Bibles</EM> of less interest to the
graphic antiquary. In my next letter you shall see what use I have made of
the unrestrained liberty granted me, by the kind-hearted Curators, to open
what doors, and examine what volumes, I pleased. Meanwhile let me
introduce you to the excellent MONSIEUR GAIL, who is sitting at yonder
desk--examining a beautiful Greek MS. of Polybius, which once belonged to
Henry II. and his favourite Diane de Poictiers. M. Gail is the chief
Librarian presiding over the Greek and Latin MSS., and is himself
Professor of the Greek language in the royal college of France. Of this
gentleman I shall speak more particularly anon. At the present moment it
may suffice only to observe that he is thoroughly frank, amiable, and
communicative, and dexterous in his particular vocation: and that he is,
what we should both call, a hearty, good fellow--a natural character. M.
Gail is accompanied by the assistant librarians MM. De. l'EPINE, and MÉON:
gentlemen of equal ability in their particular department, and at all
times willing to aid and abet the researches of those who come to examine
and appreciate the treasures of which they are the joint Curators. Indeed
I cannot speak too highly of these gentlemen--nor can I too much admire
the system and the silence which uniformly prevail.</P>

<P>Another principal librarian is M. LANGLÈS:<A name="fnref_28"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_28">28</A> an author of equal reputation with
Monsieur Gail--but his strength lies in Oriental literature; and he
presides more especially over the Persian, Arabic, and other Oriental MSS.
To the naïveté of M. Gail, he adds the peculiar vivacity and enthusiasm of
his countrymen. To see him presiding in his chair (for he and M. Gail take
alternate turns) and occupied in reading, you would think that a book worm
could scarcely creep between the tip of his nose and the surface of the
<EM>Codex Bombycinus</EM> over which he is poring. He is among the most
short-sighted of mortals--as to <EM>ocular</EM> vision. But he has a
bravely furnished mind; and such a store of spirits and of good
humour--talking withal unintermittingly, but very pleasantly---that you
find it difficult to get away from him. He is no indifferent speaker of
our own language; and I must say, seems rather proud of such an
acquirement. Both he and M. Gail, and M. Van Praet, are men of rather
small, stature--<EM>triplicates</EM>, as it were, of the same work<A name=
"fnref_29"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_29">29</A>--but of which M. Gail
is the tallest copy. One of the two head librarians, just mentioned, sits
at a desk in the second room--and when any friends come to see, or to
converse with him--the discussion is immediately adjourned to the
contiguous boudoir-like apartment, where are deposited the rich old
bindings of which you have just had a hasty description. Here the voices
are elevated, and the flourishes of speech and of action freely indulged
in.</P>

<P>In the way to the further apartment, from the boudoir so frequently
mentioned, you pass a small room--in which there is a plaster bust of the
King--and among the books, bound, as they almost all are, in red morocco,
you observe two volumes of tremendously thick dimensions; the one entitled
<EM>Alexander Aphrodiæsus, Hippocrates, &amp;c.</EM>--the other
<EM>Plutarchi Vitæ Parallelæ et Moralia, &amp;c.</EM> They contain nothing
remarkable for ornament, or what is more essential, for intrinsic worth.
Nevertheless you pass on: and the last--but the most magnificent--of
<EM>all</EM> the rooms, appropriated to the reception of books, whether in
ms. or in print, now occupies a very considerable portion of your
attention. It is replete with treasures of every description: in ancient
art, antiquities, and both sacred and profane learning: in languages from
all quarters, and almost of all ages of the world. Here I opened, with
indescribable delight the ponderous and famous <EM>Latin Bible of Charles
the Bald</EM>--and the religious manual of his brother the <EM>Emperor
Lotharius</EM>--composed chiefly of transcripts from the Gospels. Here are
ivory bindings, whether as diptychs, or attached to regular volumes. Here
are all sorts and sizes of the uncial or capital-letter MSS--in portions,
or entire. Here, too, are very precious old illuminations, and
specimens--almost without number-- admirably arranged, of every species of
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL VIRTÙ, which cannot fail to fix the attention, enlarge the
knowledge, and improve the judgment, of the curious in this department of
research.</P>

<P>Such, my dear friend, is the necessarily rapid--and, I fear,
consequently imperfect--sketch which I send you of the general character
of the BIBLIOTHÈQUE DU ROI; both as respects its dead and its living
treasures. It remains to be seen how this sketch will be completed.--- and
I hereby give you notice, that my next letter will contain some account of
a few of the more ancient, curious, and splendid MANUSCRIPTS--to be
followed by a second letter, exclusively devoted to a similar account of
the PRINTED BOOKS. If I execute this task according to my present
inclinations--and with the disposition which I now feel, together with the
opportunities which have been afforded me--it will not, I trust, be said
that I have been an idle or unworthy visitor of this magnificent
collection.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER III.</H3>

<P>THE SAME SUBJECTS CONTINUED.</P>

<P><EM>Paris, June 14, 1818.</EM></P>

<P>As I promised, at the conclusion of my last, you shall accompany me
immediately to the ROYAL LIBRARY; and taking down a few of the more
ancient MANUSCRIPTS relating to <EM>Theology</EM>--especially those,
which, from age, art, or intrinsic worth, demand a more particular
examination--we will both sit down together to the enjoyment of what the
librarians have placed before us. In other words, I shall proceed to fill
up the outline (executed with a hurrying pencil) which was submitted to
you in my previous letter. First, therefore, for</P>

<P>BIBLES, LITURGIES, RITUALS, LEGENDS, MORAL TREATISES, &amp;C.</P>

<P><EM>Quatuor Evangelia. "Codex Membranaceus, Olim Abbatiæ S. Medardi
Suessionensis in uncialibus litteris et auricis scriptus. Sæc. VI."</EM>
The preceding is written in an old hand, inserted in the book. It is a
folio volume of unquestionably great antiquity; but I should apprehend
that it is <EM>antedated</EM> by at least <EM>two</EM> centuries. It is
full of embellishment, of a varied and splendid character. The title to
each Gospel is in very large capital letters of gold, upon a purple
ground: both the initial letter and the border round the page being
elaborately ornamented. The letter prefixed to St. Matthew's Gospel is
highly adorned, and in very good taste. Each page consists of two columns,
in capital letters of gold, throughout: within borders of a quiet purple,
or lilac tint, edged with gold. It has been said that no two borders are
alike altogether. A portrait of each Evangelist is prefixed to the title;
apparently coeval with the time: the composition is rather grotesque; the
colours are without any glaze, and the perspective is bad.</P>

<P>LATIN BIBLE OF CHARLES THE BALD. Folio. When this volume was described
by me, on a former occasion,<A name="fnref_30"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_30">30</A> from merely printed authorities, of course it was not in
my power to do it, if I may so speak, "after the life,"--for although
nearly ten centuries have elapsed since this Bible has been executed, yet,
considering its remote age, it may be said to be fresh and in most
desirable condition. The authority, just hinted at, notices that this
magnificent volume was deposited in the library by <EM>Baluze</EM>, the
head librarian to Colbert; but a note in that eminent man's hand writing,
prefixed, informs us that the Canons of the Cathedral church at Metz made
Colbert a present of it.</P>

<P>The reverse of the last leaf but one is occupied by Latin verses, in
capital letters of gold, at the top of which, in two lines, we make out--"
<EM>Qualiter uiuian monachus sci martini consecrat hanc bibliam Karolo
ipatorj</EM>," &amp;c. The ensuing and last leaf is probably, in the eye
of an antiquarian virtuoso, more precious than either of its decorative
precursors. It exhibits the PORTRAIT OF CHARLES THE BALD; who is
surrounded by four attendants, blended, as it were, with a group of twelve
below--in the habits of priests--listening to the oration of one, who
stands nearly in the centre.<A name="fnref_31"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_31">31</A> This illumination, in the whole, measures about fourteen
inches in height by nearly ten and a half in width: the purple ground
being frequently faded into a greenish tint. The volume itself is about
twenty inches in height by fifteen wide.</P>

<P>PSALTER OF CHARLES THE BALD. This very precious volume was also in the
library of the Great Colbert. It is a small quarto, bound in the most
sumptuous manner. The exterior of the first side of the binding has an
elaborate piece of sculpture, in ivory, consisting of small human figures,
beasts, &amp;c.; and surrounded with oval and square coloured stones. The
exterior of the other, or corresponding, side of the binding has the same
species of sculpture, in ivory; but no stones. The text of the volume is
in gold capitals throughout; but the ornaments, as well as the portrait of
Charles, are much inferior to those in that just described. However, this
is doubtless a valuable relic.</P>

<P>PRAYER BOOK OF CHARLES THE BALD; in small 4to. This is rather an
<EM>Evangelistarium</EM>, or excerpts from the four Gospels. The writing
is a small roman lower-case. The illuminations, like those in the Bible,
are rubbed and faded, and they are smaller. The exterior ornament of the
binding, in the middle, contains a group of ivory figures--taken from the
<EM>original</EM> covering or binding.</P>

<P>BOOK OF THE GOSPELS, OF THE EMPEROR LOTHARIUS. Although it is very
probable that this book may be of a somewhat earlier date than the MS.
just described, yet as its original possessor was brother to <EM>Charles
the Bald</EM>, it is but courtesy to place him in the second rank after
the French monarch; and accordingly I have here inserted the volume in the
order which I apprehend ought to be observed. An ancient ms. memorandum
tells us that this book was executed in the 855th year of the Christian
era, and in the 15th of the Emperor's reign. On the reverse of the first
leaf is the portrait of the Emperor, with an attendant on each side. The
text commences on the recto of the second leaf. On the reverse of the same
leaf, is a representation of the Creator. Upon the whole, this book may be
classed among the most precious specimens of early art in this library. On
the cover are the royal arms.</P>

<P>LATIN BIBLE. Fol. This MS. of the sacred text is in four folio volumes,
and undoubtedly cannot be later than the thirteenth century. The text is
written with three columns in each page. Of the illuminations, the figures
are sketches, but freely executed: the colouring coarse and slightly put
on: the wings of some of the angels reminded me of those in the curious
<EM>Hyde-Book</EM>, belonging to the Marquis of Buckingham at Stowe; and
of which, as you may remember, there are fac-similes in <EM>the
Bibliographical Decameron</EM>.<A name="fnref_32"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_32">32</A> The group of angels (on the reverse of the fourth
leaf of the first volume), attending the Almighty's commands, is cleverly
managed as to the draperies. The soldiers have quilted or net armour. The
initial letters are sometimes large, in the fashion of those in the Bible
of Charles the Bald, but very inferior in execution. In this MS. we may
trace something, I think, of the decline of art.</P>

<P>PSALTERIUM LATINÈ, 8vo. If I were called upon to select any one volume,
of given octavo dimensions, I do not know whether I should not put my hand
upon the <EM>present</EM>--for you are hereby to know that this was the
religious manual of ST. LOUIS:--his own choice copy--selected, I warrant,
from half a score of performances of rival scribes, rubricators, and
illuminators. Its condition is absolutely wonderful--nor is the history of
its locomotiveness less surprising. First, for an account of its contents.
On the reverse of the first fly-leaf, we read the following memorandum--in
red: "<EM>Cest psaultier fu saint loys. Et le dõna la royne Iehanne
deureux au roy Charles filz du roy Iehan, lan de nres' mil troys cens
soissante et neuf. Et le roy charles pnt filz du dit Roy charles le donna
a madame Marie de frãce sa fille religieuse a poissi. le iour saint michel
lan mil iiij<SUP>c</SUP>.</EM>" This hand writing is undoubtedly of the
time.</P>

<P>A word now about the history of this volume. As this extract indicates,
it was deposited in a monastery at Poissy. When that establishment was
dissolved, the book was brought to M. Chardin, a bookseller and a
bibliomaniac. He sold it, some twenty-five years ago, to a Russian
gentleman, from whom it was obtained, at Moscow, by the Grand Duke
Nicholas.<A name="fnref_33"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_33">33</A> The
late King of France, through his ambassador, the Count de Noailles,
obtained it from the Grand Duke--who received, in return, from his
Majesty, a handsome present of two Sèvre vases. It is now therefore safely
and judiciously lodged in the Royal Library of France. It is in wooden
covers, wrapped in red velvet. The vellum is singularly soft, and of its
original pure tint.</P>

<P>HISTORICAL PARAPHRASE OF THE BIBLE. Lat. and Fr. Folio. If any MS. of
the sacred text were to be estimated according to the <EM>number of the
illuminations</EM> which it contained, the present would unquestionably
claim precedence over every other. In short, this is the MS. of which
Camus, in the <EM>Notices et Extraits des MSS. de la Bibliothèque
Nationale</EM>, vol. vi. p. 106, has given not only a pretty copious
account, but has embellished that account with fac-similes--one large
plate, and two others--each containing four subjects of the illuminations.
After an attentive survey of the various styles of art observable in these
decorations, I am not disposed to allow the antiquity of the MS. to go
beyond the commencement of the XVth century. A sight of the frontispiece
causes a re-action of the blood in a lover of genuine large margins. The
book is cropt--not <EM>quite</EM> to the quick!... but then this
frontispiece displays a most delicate and interesting specimen of graphic
art. It is executed in a sort of gray tone:--totally destitute of other
colour. According to Camus, there are upwards of five thousand
illuminations; and a similar work, in his estimation, could not
<EM>now</EM> be executed under 100,000 francs.</P>

<P>A SIMILAR MS. This consists but of one volume, of a larger size, of 321
leaves. It is also an historical Bible. The illuminations are arranged in
a manner like those of the preceding; but in black and white only,
delicately shaded. The figures are tall, and the females have small heads;
just what we observe in those of the <EM>Roman d'Alexandre</EM>, in the
Bodleian library. It is doubtless a manuscript of nearly the same age,
although this may be somewhat more recent.</P>

<P>LIBER GENERATIONIS IHI XTI. Of all portions of the sacred text--not
absolutely a consecutive series of the Gospels, or of any of the books of
the Old Testament--the present is probably, not only the oldest MS. in
that particular department, but, with the exception of the well known
<EM>Codex Claromontanus</EM>, the most ancient volume in the Royal
Library. It is a folio, having purple leaves throughout, upon which the
text is executed in silver capitals. Both the purple and the silver are
faded. On the exterior of the binding are carvings in ivory, exceedingly
curious, but rather clumsy. The binding is probably coeval with the MS.
They call it of the ninth century; but I should rather estimate it of the
eighth. It is undoubtedly an interesting and uncommon volume.</P>

<P>EVANGELIUM STI. IOHANNIS. This is a small oblong folio, bound in red
velvet. It is executed in a very large, lower-case, coarse gothic and
roman letter, alternately:--in letters of gold throughout. The page is
narrow, the margin is large, and the vellum soft and beautiful. There is a
rude portrait of the Evangelist prefixed, on a ground entirely of gold.
The capital initial letter is also rude. The date of this manuscript is
pushed as high as the eleventh century: but I doubt this antiquity.</P>

<P>LIBER PRECUM: CUM NOTIS, CANTICIS ET FIGURIS. I shall begin my account
of PRAYER BOOKS, BREVIARIES, &amp;C. with the present: in all probability
the most ancient within these walls. The volume before me is an oblong
folio, not much unlike a tradesman's day-book. A ms. note by Maugerard,
correcting a previous one, assigns the composition of this book to a
certain Monk, of the name of <EM>Wickingus</EM>, of the abbey of Prum, of
the Benedictin order. It was executed, as appears on the reverse of the
forty-eighth leaf, "<EM>under the abbotships of Gilderius and
Stephanus</EM>." It is full of illuminations, heavily and clumsily done,
in colours, which are now become very dull. I do not consider it as older
than the twelfth century, from the shield with a boss, and the depressed
helmet. There are interlineary annotations in a fine state of
preservation. In the whole, ninety-one leaves. It is bound in red
morocco.</P>

<P>BREVIARE DE BELLEVILLE: Octavo. 2 volumes. Rich and rare as may be the
graphic gems in this marvellous collection, I do assure you, my good
friend, that it would be difficult to select two octavo volumes of greater
intrinsic curiosity and artist-like execution, than are those to which I
am now about to introduce you:--especially the first. They were latterly
the property of Louis XIV. but had been originally a present from Charles
VI. to our Richard II. Thus you see a good deal of personal history is
attached to them. They are written in a small, close, Gothic character,
upon vellum of the most beautiful colour. Each page is surrounded by a
border, (executed in the style of the age--perhaps not later than 1380)
and very many pages are adorned by illuminations, especially in the first
volume, which are, even now, as fresh and perfect as if just painted. The
figures are small, but have more finish (to the best of my recollection)
than those in our Roman d'Alexandre, at Oxford.</P>

<P>At the end of the first volume is the following inscription--written in
a stiff, gothic, or court-hand character: the capital letters being very
tall and highly ornamented. "<EM>Cest Breuiare est a l'usaige des
Jacobins. Et est en deux volumes Dont cest cy Le premier, et est nomme Le
Breuiaire de Belleville. Et le donna el Roy Charles le vj<SUP>e</SUP>. Au
roy Richart Dangleterre, quant il fut mort Le Roy Henry son successeur
L'envoya a son oncle Le Duc de Berry, auquel il est a present."</EM> This
memorandum has the signature of "Flamel," who was Secretary to Charles VI.
On the opposite page, in the same ancient Gothic character, we read:
"<EM>Lesquelz volumes mon dit Seigneur a donnez a ma Dame Seur Marie de
France. Ma niepce."</EM> Signed by the same. The Abbé L'Epine informs me
that Flamel was a very distinguished character among the French: and that
the royal library contains several books which belonged to him.</P>

<P>BREVIARY OF JOHN DUKE OF BEDFORD. Pursuing what I imagine to be a
tolerably correct chronological order, I am now about to place before you
this far-famed <EM>Breviary</EM>: companion to the MISSAL which originally
belonged to the same eminent Possessor, and of which our countrymen<A
name="fnref_34"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_34">34</A> have had more
frequent opportunities of appreciating the splendour and beauty than the
Parisians; as it is not likely that the former will ever again become the
property of an Englishman. Doubtless, at the sale of the Duchess of
Portland's effects in 1786, some gallant French nobleman, if not Louis
XVI. himself, should have given an unlimited commission to purchase it, in
order that both <EM>Missal</EM> and <EM>Breviary</EM> might have resumed
that close and intimate acquaintance, which no doubt originally subsisted
between them, when they lay side by side upon the oaken shelves of their
first illustrious Owner. Of the <EM>two</EM> performances, however, there
can be no question that the superiority lies decidedly with the
<EM>Missal</EM>: on the score of splendour, variety, and skilfulness of
execution.</P>

<P>The last, and by much the most splendid illumination, is <EM>that</EM>
for which the artists of the middle age, and especially the old
illuminators, seem to have reserved all their powers, and upon which they
lavished all their stock of gold, ultramarine, and carmine. You will
readily anticipate that I am about to add--the <EM>Assumption of the
Virgin</EM>. One's memory is generally fallacious in these matters; but of
all the exquisite, and of all the minute, elaborate, and dazzling works of
art, of the illuminatory kind, I am quite sure that I have not seen any
thing which <EM>exceeds</EM> this. To <EM>equal</EM> it--there may be some
few: but its superior, (of its own particular class of subject) I think it
would be very difficult to discover.</P>

<P>HORÆ BEATÆ MARIÆ VIRGINIS. This may be called either a large thick
octavo, or a very small folio. Probably it was originally more decidedly
of the latter kind. It is bound in fish skin; and a ms. note prefixed thus
informs us. "<EM>Manuscrit aqui du C<SUP>en</SUP> Papillon au commencement
du mois de Frimaire de lan XII. de la République."</EM> This is without
doubt among the most superb and beautiful books, of its class, in the
Royal Library. The title is ornamented in an unusual but splendid manner.
Some of the larger illuminations are elaborately executed; especially the
first-- representing the <EM>Annunciation</EM>. The robe of the Angel,
kneeling, is studded with small pearls, finished with the minutest
touches. The character of ART, generally throughout, is that of the time
and manner of the volume last described: but the present is very
frequently inferior in merit to what may be observed in the Bedford
Breviary. In regard to the number of decorations, this volume must also be
considered as less interesting: but it possesses some very striking and
very brilliant performances. Thus, <EM>St. Michael and the Devil</EM> is
absolutely in a blaze of splendor; while the illumination on the reverse
of the same leaf is not less remarkable for a different effect. A quiet,
soft tone--from a profusion of tender touches of a grey tint, in the
architectural parts of the ornaments--struck me as among the most pleasing
specimens of the kind I had ever seen. The latter and larger illuminations
have occasionally great power of effect, from their splendid style of
execution--especially that in which the central compartment is occupied by
<EM>St. George and the Dragon</EM>. Some of the smaller illuminations, in
which an Angel is shewing the cruelties about to be inflicted on the
wicked, by demons, are terrific little bits! As for the vellum, it is "de
toute beauté."</P>

<P>HISTORIA BEATÆ MARIÆ VIRGINIS. Folio. This is briefly described in the
printed catalogue, under number 6811. It is a large and splendid folio, in
a very fine state of preservation; but of which the art is, upon the
whole, of the ordinary and secondary class of merit. Yet it is doubtless a
volume of great interest and curiosity. Even to English feelings, it will
be gratifying to observe in it the portrait of <EM>Louisa of Savoy</EM>,
mother of Francis I. That illustrious lady is sitting in a chair,
surrounded by her attendants; and is in all probability a copy from the
life. The performance is a metrical composition, in stanzas of eleven
verses. I select the opening lines, because they relate immediately to the
portrait in question.</P>

<P class="poetry"><EM>Tres excellente illustre et magnificque<BR>

<P>HOURS OF ANNE OF BRITTANY. The order of this little catalogue of a few
of the more splendid and curious ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS, in the Royal
Library of France, has at length, my worthy friend, brought me in contact
with the magical and matchless volume usually designated by the foregoing
title. You are to know--in the first place--that, of ALL the volumes in
this most marvellous Library, the present is deemed THE MOST PRECIOUS. Not
even the wishes and regulations of Royalty itself allow of its migration
beyond the walls of the public library. There it is kept: there it is
opened, and shewn, and extolled beyond any limits fixed to the admiration
of the beholder. It is a rare and bewitching piece of art, I do assure
you: and so, raising your expectations to their highest pitch, I will
allow you to anticipate whatever is wonderful in FRANCESCO VERONESE and
gorgeous in GIROLAMO DEI LIBRI.<A name="fnref_35"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_35">35</A> Perhaps, however, this is not the most happy
illustration of the art which it displays.</P>

<P>The first view of this magical volume is doubtless rather
disheartening: but the sight of the original silver clasps (luckily still
preserved) will operate by way of a comforter. Upon them you observe this
ornament:</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><IMG width="100%"
src="images/086.png" alt=
"A"></DIV>

<P>denoting, by the letter and the ducal crown, that the book belonged to
Anne, Duchess of Brittany. On the reverse of the second leaf we observe
the <EM>Dead Christ</EM> and the <EM>three Maries</EM>. These figures are
about six inches in height. They are executed with great delicacy, but in
a style somewhat too feeble for their size. One or two of the heads,
however, have rather a good expression.</P>

<P>Opposite to this illumination is the <EM>truly invaluable</EM> PORTRAIT
OF ANNE herself: attended by two females, each crowned with a glory; one
is displaying a banner, the other holding a cross in her hand. To the left
of these attendants, is an old woman, hooded, with her head encircled by a
glory. They are all three sweetly and delicately touched; but there are
many evident marks of injury and ill usage about the surface of the
colouring. Yet, as being <EM>ideal</EM> personages, my eye hastily glided
off them to gaze upon the illustrious Lady, by whose orders, and at whose
expense, these figures were executed. It is upon the DUCHESS that I fix my
eye, and lavish my commendations. Look at her<A name="fnref_36"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_36">36</A> as you here behold her. Her gown is
brown and gold, trimmed with dark brown fur. Her hair is brown. Her
necklace is composed of coloured jewels. Her cheek has a fresh tint; and
the missal, upon which her eyes are bent, displays highly ornamented art.
The cloth upon the table is dark crimson.</P>

<P>The <EM>Calendar</EM> follows; in which, in one of the winter months,
we observe a very puerile imitation of flakes of snow falling over the
figures and the landscape below. The calendar occupies a space of about
six inches by four, completely enclosed by a coloured margin. Then begins
a series of the most beautiful ornaments of FLOWERS, FRUITS, INSECTS,
&amp;C. for which the illuminators of this period were often eminently
distinguished. These ornaments are almost uniformly introduced in the
fore-edges, or right-side margins, of the leaves; although occasionally,
but rarely, they encircle the text. They are from five to six inches in
length, or height; having the Latin name of the plant at top, and the
French name at the bottom. Probably these titles were introduced by a
later hand. It is really impossible to describe many of them in terms of
adequate praise. The downy plum is almost bursting with ripeness: the
butterfly's wings seem to be in tremulous motion, while they dazzle you by
their varied lustre: the hairy insect puts every muscle and fibre into
action, as he insinuates himself within the curling of the crisped leaves;
while these leaves are sometimes glittering with dew, or coated with the
finest down. The flowers and the vegetables are equally admirable, and
equally true to nature. To particularise would be endless. Assuredly these
efforts of art have no rival--of their kind. <EM>Scripture Subjects.
Saints, Confessors, &amp;c.</EM> succeed in regular order, with
accompaniments of fruits and flowers, more or less exquisitely
executed:--the whole, a collection of peculiar, and, of its kind,
UNRIVALLED ART. This extraordinary volume measures twelve inches by seven
and a half.</P>

<P>HOURS BELONGING TO POPE PAUL III. 8vo. The portrait of the Pope is at
the bottom of the first ornament, which fixes the period of its execution
to about the middle of the sixteenth century. Towards the end the pages
are elaborately ornamented in the arabesque manner. There are some
pleasing children: of that style of art which is seen in the Missal
belonging to Sir M.M. Sykes, of the time of Francis I.<A name=
"fnref_37"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_37">37</A> The scription is very
beautiful. The volume afterwards belonged to Pius VI., whose arms are
worked in tambour on the outside. It is kept in a case, and is doubtless a
fine book.</P>

<P>MISSALS: numbers 19-4650. Under this head I shall notice two pretty
volumes of the devotional kind; of which the subjects are executed in red,
blue, &amp;c.--and of which the one seems to be a copy of the other. The
borders exhibit a style of art somewhat between that of Julio Clovio and
what is seen in the famous Missal just mentioned.</P>

<P>MISSAL OF HENRY IV. No. 1171. This book is of the end of the XVIth
century. The ground is gold, with a small brilliant, roman letter for
text. The subjects are executed in a pale chocolate tint, rather
capricious than tasteful. It has been cropt in the binding. The name and
arms of Henry are on the exterior.</P>

<P>Thus much, my dear friend, for the SACRED TEXT--either in its original,
uninterrupted state--or as partially embodied in <EM>Missals</EM>,
<EM>Hours</EM>, or <EM>Rituals</EM>. I think it will now be but reasonable
to give you some little respite from the toil of further perusal;
especially as the next class of MSS. is so essentially different. In the
mean while, I leave you to carry the image of ANNE OF BRITTANY to your
pillow, to beguile the hours of languor or of restlessness. A hearty
adieu.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER IV.</H3>

<P>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</P>

<P>Are you thoroughly awake, and disenchanted from the magic which the
contents of the preceding letter may have probably thrown around you?
Arouse--to scenes of a different aspect, but of a not less splendid and
spirit-stirring character. Buckle on your helmet, ... for the trumpet
sounds to arms. The <EM>Knights of the Round Table</EM> call upon you,
from their rock-hewn, or wood-embowered, recesses, to be vigilant,
faithful, enterprising, and undaunted. In language less elevated, and
somewhat more intelligible, I am about to place before you a few
illuminated MSS. relating to HISTORY and ROMANCE; not without, in the
first place, making a digression into one or two volumes of MORALITIES, if
they may be so called. Prepare therefore, in the first place, for the
inspection of a couple of volumes--which, for size, splendor, and general
state of preservation, have no superior in the Royal Library of
France.</P>

<P>CITÉ DE DIEU: No. 6712: folio. 2 vols. These are doubtless among the
most magnificent <EM>shew-books</EM> in this collection; somewhat similar,
in size and style of art, to the MS. of <EM>Valerius Maximus</EM>, in our
British Museum--of which, should you not have forgotten it, some account
may be read in the <EM>Bibliographical Decameron</EM>.<A name=
"fnref_38"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_38">38</A> At the very first
page we observe an assemblage of Popes, Cardinals, and Bishops, with a
King seated on his throne in the midst of them. The figures in the
fore-ground are from four to five inches high; and so in gradation
upwards. The colouring of some of the draperies is in a most delightful
tone. The countenances have also a soft and quiet expression. The arms of
<EM>Graville</EM> (Grãuille?) are in the circular border. Three leaves
beyond, a still larger and more crowded illumination appears--in a
surprising state of freshness and beauty; measuring nearly a foot and a
half in height. It is prefixed to the <EM>First Book</EM>, and is divided
into a group in the clouds, and various groups upon the earth below. These
latter are representations of human beings in all situations and
occupations of life--exhibiting the prevalence both of virtues and vices.
They are encircled at bottom by a group of Demons. The figures do not
exceed two inches in height. Nothing can exceed the delicacy and
brilliancy of this specimen of art about the middle of the fifteenth
century:---a ms. date of 1469 shewing the precise period of its execution.
This latter is at the end of the first volume. Each book, into which the
work is divided, has a large illumination prefixed, of nearly equal beauty
and splendor.</P>

<P>LES ECHECS AMOUREUX. Folio. No. 6808. The title does not savour of any
moral application to be derived from the perusal of the work.
Nevertheless, there are portions of it which were evidently written with
that view. It is so lovely, and I had almost said so matchless, a volume,
that you ought to rejoice to have an account of it in any shape. On the
score of delicate, fresh, carefully-executed art, this folio may challenge
comparison with any similar treasure in the Bibliothèque du Roi. The
subjects are not crowded, nor minute; nor of a very wonderful and
intricate nature; but they are quietly composed, softly executed, and are,
at this present moment, in a state of preservation perfectly beautiful and
entire.</P>

<P>BOCCACE; DES CAS DES NOBLES HOMMES ET FEMMES: No. 6878. The present
seems to be the fit place to notice this very beautiful folio volume of
one of the most popular works of Boccaccio. Copies of it, both in ms. and
early print--are indeed common in foreign libraries. There is a date of
1409 at the very commencement of the volume: but I take the liberty to
question whether that be the date of its actual execution. The
illuminations in this manuscript exhibit a fine specimen of the
commencement of that soft, and as some may think woolly, style of art,
which appears to so much advantage in the <EM>Bedford Missal and Bedford
Breviary</EM>; and of which, indeed, a choice specimen of circular
ornaments is seen round the first large illumination of the creation and
expulsion of Adam and Eve. These illuminations are not of first rate
merit, nor are they all by the same hand.</P>

<P>THE SAME WORK: with the same date--but the hand-writing is evidently
more modern. Of the illuminations, it will be only necessary to mention
the large one at fol. iij.c. (ccc.) in which the gray tints and the gold
are very cleverly managed. At the end is seen, in a large sprawling
character, the following inscription: "<EM>Ce Livre est A Le Harne. Fille
Et Seur de Roys de France, Duchesse de Bourbonnois et dauuergne. Contesse
de Clermont et de Tourez. Dame de Beaujeu."</EM> This inscription bears
the date of 1468; not very long before which I suspect the MS. to have
been executed.</P>

<P>THE SAME: of the same date--which date I am persuaded was copied by
each succeeding scribe. The illuminations are here generally of a very
inferior character: but the first has much merit, and is by a superior
hand. The text is executed in a running secretary Gothic. There are two
other MSS. of the same work which I examined; and in one of which the well
known subject of the <EM>wheel of fortune</EM> is perhaps represented for
the first time. It usually accompanied the printed editions, and may be
seen in that of our Pynson, in 1494,<A name="fnref_39"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_39">39</A> folio. I suspect, from one of the
introductory prefaces, that the celebrated <EM>Laurent le Premier
Fait</EM> was the principal scribe who gave a sort of fashion to this MS.
in France.</P>

<P>PTOLEMÆUS, <EM>Latinè</EM>. A magnificent MS.--if size and condition be
alone considered. It is however precious in the estimation of Collectors
of portraits, as it contains one of Louis XII;<A name="fnref_40"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_40">40</A>--This portrait is nearly in the centre
of the frontispiece to the book. Behind the monarch stand two men; one
leaning upon his staff. A large gothic window is above. A crucifix and
altar are beneath it. There is but one other similar illumination in the
volume; and each nearly occupies the whole of the page--which is almost
twenty-three inches long by fourteen wide. The other illumination is
hardly worth describing. This noble volume, which almost made the bearer
stoop beneath its weight, is bound in wood:--covered with blue velvet,
with a running yellow pattern, of the time of Louis--but now almost worn
away.</P>

<P>TITE-LIVE. Fol. A noble and magnificent MS. apparently of the beginning
of the XVth. century. It seems to point out the precise period when the
artists introduced those soft, full-coloured, circular borders--just after
the abandonment of the sharp outline, and thin coat of
colour--discoverable in the illuminations of the XIIIth and XIVth
centuries. The first grand illumination, with a circular border, is an
interesting illustration of this remark. The backgrounds to the pictures
are the well-known small bright squares of blue and gold. The text is in a
firm square and short gothic character.</P>

<P>L'HISTOIRE ROMAINE: No. 6984: Folio, 3 vols. written in the French
language. These are among the <EM>shew books</EM> of the library. The
exterior pattern of the binding is beautiful in the extreme. Such a play
of lines, in all directions, but chiefly circular, I never before saw. The
date, on the outside, is 1556. The writing and the illuminations are of
the latter part of the XVth century; and although they are gorgeous, and
in a fine state of preservation, yet is the character of the art but
secondary, and rather common.</P>

<P>ROYAL BIOGRAPHY OF FRANCE. Fol. This exquisite volume may be justly
designated as the <EM>nonpareil</EM> of its kind. It is rather a book of
PORTRAITS, than a MS. with intermixed illuminations. The scription, in a
sort of cursive, secretary gothic character, merits not a moment's
attention: the pencil of the artist having wholly eclipsed the efforts of
the scribe. Such a series of exquisitely finished portraits, of all the
Kings of France (with the unaccountable omission, unless it has been taken
out, of that of Louis XII.) is perhaps no where else to be seen. M.
Coeuré, the French artist employed by me, stood in ecstasies before it!
These portraits are taken from old monuments, missals, and other ancient
and supposed authentic documents. They are here touched and finished in a
manner the most surprisingly perfect. The book appears to have been
executed expressly for CHARLES IX.--to whom it was in fact presented by
<EM>Dutilliet</EM>, (the artist or the superintendant of the volume) in
his proper person. The gilt stamp of the two reversed C's are on the sides
of the binding. I should add, that the portraits are surrounded by borders
of gold, shaded in brown, in the arabesque manner. All the portraits are
whole lengths; and if my time and pursuits had permitted it, I should, ere
this, have caused M. Coeuré to have transfused a little of his enthusiasm
into faithful facsimiles of those of Francis I.--my avowed favourite--of
which one represents him in youth, and the other in old age. Why do not
the Noblesse of France devote some portion of that wealth, which may be
applied to worse purposes, in obtaining a series of engravings executed
from this matchless volume?!</P>

<P>ROMANCES, BOOKS OF TOURNAMENT, &amp;c.</P>

<P>LANCELOT DU LAC shall lead the way. He was always considered among the
finest fellows who ever encircled the <EM>Table Ronde</EM>--and
<EM>such</EM> a copy of his exploits, as is at this moment before me, it
is probably not very easy for even Yourself to conceive. If the height and
bulk of the knight were in proportion to this written record of
achievements, the plume of his helmet must have brushed the clouds. This
enormous volume (No. 6783) is divided into three books or parts: of which
the first part is illuminated in the usual coarse style of the latter end
of the XIVth century. The title to this first part, in red ink, is the
most perfect resemblance of the earliest type used by Caxton, which I
remember to have seen in an ancient manuscript. The other titles do not
exhibit that similarity. The first part has ccxlviij. leaves. The second
part has no illuminations: if we except a tenderly touched outline, in a
brownish black, upon the third leaf--which is much superior to any
specimen of art in the volume. This second part has cccj. leaves. At the
end:--</P>

<P CLASS="quote"><EM>Sensuit le liure du saint graal</EM>.</P>

<P>The spaces for illuminations are regularly preserved, but by what
accident or design they were not filled up remains to be conjectured. The
third part, or book, is fully illuminated like the first. There is a very
droll illumination on folio vij.<SUP>xx</SUP>. xij. At the end of the
volume, on folio ccxxxiij., recto, is the following date: "<EM>Aujourduy
iiij. Jour du Jullet lan mil ccc. soixante dix a este escript ce livre
darmes par Micheaugatelet prestre demeurant en la ville de Tournay</EM>."
Just before the colophon, on the reverse of the preceding leaf, is a
common-place illumination of the interment of a figure in a white
sheet--with this incription:</P>

<P CLASS="quote">ICI: GIST. LECORS: GALAHAVT: SEIGNEVR DES. LOINTENES.
ILES. ET.
AVECQVES. LVI. REPOVSE: MESIRE LANCELOT. DVLAC. MELLIEVR. CHRL. DV. MVDE.
APRES. GVALEAT.</P>

<P>There are two or three more illuminated MSS. of our well-beloved
Lancelot. One, in six volumes, has illuminations, but they are of the
usual character of those of the fifteenth century.</P>

<P>LANCELOT DU LAC, &amp;C. This MS. is in three volumes. The first
contains only, as it were, an incipient illumination: but there is
preserved, on the reverse of the binding, and written in the same
character with the text, three lines--of which the private history, or
particular application, is now forgotten--although we learn, from the word
<EM>bloys</EM> being written at top, that this MS. came from the library
of Catherine de Medici--when she resided at Blois.</P>

<P>The second volume of this copy is in quite a different character, and
much older than the first. The colophon assigns to it the date of 1344.
The volume is full of illuminations, and the first leaf exhibits a fair
good specimen of those drolleries which are so frequently seen in
illuminated MSS. of that period. The third volume is in a still different
hand-writing: perhaps a little more ancient. It has a few slight
illuminations, only as capital initials.</P>

<P>LANCELOT DU LAC: No. 6782. This MS. is executed in a small gothic
character, in ink which has now become much faded. From the character of
the illuminations, I should consider it to be much more ancient than
either of the preceding--even at the commencement of the thirteenth
century. Among the illuminations there is a very curious one, with this
prefix;</P>

<P><EM>Vne dame venant a.c. chr. q dort en son<BR>
lit &amp; ele le volt baisier. mais vne<BR>
damoiselle li deffendi</EM></P>

<P>You will not fail to bear in mind that the history of Lancelot du Lac
will be also found in those of Tristan and Arthur. I shall now therefore
introduce you to a MS. or two relating to the former.</P>

<P>TRISTAN. No. 6957, 2 vols. <EM>folio</EM>. This is a very fine old MS.
apparently of the middle of the XIVth century. The writing and the
embellishments fairly justify this inference. The first volume contains
three hundred and fifty-one leaves. On the reverse of the last leaf but
one, is the word "<EM>anne</EM>" in large lower-case letters; but a ms.
memorandum, in a later hand, at the end, tells us that this copy was once
the property of "<EM>the late Dame Agnes" &amp;c</EM>. The second volume
is written in more of the secretary gothic character--and is probably
somewhat later than the first. It is executed in double columns. The
illuminations are little more than outlines, prettily executed upon a
white ground--or rather the vellum is uncoloured. This volume seems to
want a leaf at the commencement, and yet it has a title at top, as if the
text actually began there. The colophon is thus:</P>

<P CLASS="quote"><EM>Explicit le Romãt de. T. et de yseut<BR>
qui fut fait lan mille. iijc. iiijxx. et xix.<BR>
la veille de pasques grans.</EM></P>

<P>TRISTAN, FILS DE MELIADUS. No. 6773. A folio of almost unparalleled
breadth of back;--measuring more than six inches and a quarter, without
the binding. A beautiful illumination once graced the first leaf, divided
into four compartments, which is now almost effaced. In the third
compartment, there are two men and two women playing at chess, in a
vessel. What remains, only conveys an imperfect idea of its original
beauty. The lady seems to have received check-mate, from the melancholy
cast of her countenance, and her paralised attitude. The man is lifting up
both hands, as if in the act of exultation upon his victory. The two other
figures are attendants, who throw the dice. Upon the whole, this is among
the prettiest bits I have yet seen. It is worth noticing that the yellow
paint, like our Indian yellow, is here very much used; shaded with red.
The generality of the illuminations are fresh; but there is none of equal
beauty with that just described. From the scription, and the style of art,
I should judge this MS. to have been executed about the year 1400 or 1420;
but a memorandum, apparently in a somewhat later hand, says it was
finished in 1485:--<EM>Par Michean gonnot de la brouce pstre demeurant a
croysant.</EM> Some lines below have been scratched out. The colophon,
just before, is on the recto of the last leaf:</P>

<P CLASS="quote"><EM>Explicit le rõmans de tristan et de la Royne<BR>
Yseult la blonde Royne de cornoalle.</EM></P>

<P>TRISTAN: No. 6774. <EM>Folio.</EM> 2 vols. The illuminations are
magnificent, but lightly coloured and shaded. The draperies are in good
taste. The border to the first large illumination, in four parts, is
equally elegant in composition and colouring, and a portion of it might be
worth copying. There is a pretty illumination of two women sitting down. A
table cloth, with dinner upon it, is spread upon the grass between
them:--a bottle is plunged into a running stream from a fountain, with an
ewer on one side in the fore-ground. One woman plays upon the guitar while
the other eats her dinner. The second volume has a fine illumination
divided into four parts, with a handsome border--not quite perhaps so rich
as the preceding. Among the subjects, there is a singular one of Lancelot
du Lac helping a lady out of a cauldron in a state of nudity: two
gentlemen and a lady are quietly looking on. The text appertaining to this
subject runs thus: "<EM>Et quant elle voit lancelot si lui dist hoa sire
cheualiers pour dieu ostes moy de ceste aure ou il a eaue qui toute mait
Et lancelot vint a la aure et prent la damoiselle par la main et lentrait
hors. Et quant elle se voit deliure elle luy chiet aux pies et lui baise
la iambe et lui dist sire benoite soit leure que vous feustes oncques nes,
&amp;c</EM>." The top of the last leaf is cut off: and the date has been
probably destroyed. The colophon runs thus:</P>

<P CLASS="quote"><EM>Cy fenist le livre de tristan et de la<BR>
royne yseult de cornouaille et<BR>
le graal que plus nen va</EM>.</P>

<P>The present is a fine genuine old copy: in faded yellow morocco
binding--apparently not having been subjected to the torturing instruments
of De Rome.</P>

<P>LE ROY ARTUS. No. 6963. Folio. I consider this to be the oldest
illuminated MS. of the present Romance which I have yet seen. It is of the
date of 1274, as its colophon imports. It is written in double columns,
but the illuminations are heavy and sombre;--about two inches in height,
generally oblong. There are grotesques, attached to letters, in the
margin. The backgrounds are thick, shining gold. At the end:</P>

<P CLASS="quote"><EM>Explicit de lanselot. del lac<A
NAME="fnref_41"></A><A CLASS="fnref" HREF="#fn_41">41</A><BR>
Ces Roumans fu par escris. En lan<BR>
del Incarnation nostre Segnor. mil<BR>
deus cens et sixante et quatorse le<BR>
semedi apres pour ce li ki lescrist</EM>.</P>

<P>It is in a fine state of preservation. Mons. Méon shewed me a
manuscript of the ST. GRAAL, executed in a similar style, and written in
treble columns.</P>

<P>LE MEME. This is a metrical MS of the XIIIth century: executed in
double columns. The illuminations are small but rather coarse. It is in
fine preservation. Bound in green velvet. Formerly the outsides of this
binding had silver gilt medallions; five on each side. These have been
latterly stolen. I also saw a fine PERCEFOREST, in four large folio
volumes upon vellum, written in a comparatively modern Gothic hand. The
illuminations were to be <EM>supplied</EM>--as spaces are left for them.
There is also a paper MS. of the same Romance, not illuminated.</P>

<P>ROMAN DE LA ROSE: No. 6983. I consider this to be the oldest MS. of its
subject which I have seen. It is executed in a small Gothic character, in
two columns, with ink which has become much faded: and from the character,
both of the scription and the embellishments, I apprehend the date of it
to be somewhere about the middle of the XIVth century. The illuminations
are small, but pretty and perfect; the backgrounds are generally square,
diamond-wise, without gold; but there are backgrounds of solid shining
gold. The subjects are rather quaintly and whimsically, than elegantly,
treated. In the whole, one hundred and sixty leaves. From Romances, of all
and of every kind, let us turn our eyes towards a representation of
subjects intimately connected with them: to wit,</P>

<P>A BOOK OF TOURNAMENTS. No. 8351. Folio. This volume is in a perfect
blaze of splendour. Hither let PROSPERO and PALMERIN resort--to choose
their casques, their gauntlets, their cuirasses, and lances: yea, let more
than one-half of the Roxburghers make an annual pilgrimage to visit this
tome!--which developes, in thirteen minutes, more chivalrous intelligence
than is contained even in the mystical leaves of the <EM>Fayt of Arms and
Chyvalrye</EM> of our beloved Caxton. Be my pulse calm, and my wits
composed, as I essay the description of this marvellous volume. Beneath a
large illumination, much injured, of Louis XI. sitting upon his
throne--are the following verses:</P>

<P CLASS="poetry"><EM>Pour exemple aulx nobles et gens darmes<BR>
Qui appetent les faitz darmes hautes<BR>
Le Sire de gremthumsé duyt es armes<BR>
Volut au roy ce livre presenter</EM>.</P>

<P>Next ensue knights on horseback, heralds, &amp;c.--with a profusion of
coat-armours: each illumination occupying a full page. On the reverse of
the ninth leaf, is a most interesting illumination, in which is seen the
figure of <EM>John Duke of Brittany</EM>. He is delivering a sword to a
king at arms, to carry to his cousin, the Duke of Bourbon; as he learns,
from general report, that the Duke is among the bravest champions in
Christendom, and in consequence he wishes to break a lance with him.</P>

<P>The illumination, where the Duke thus appears, is quite perfect, and
full of interest: and I make no doubt but the countenance of the herald,
who is kneeling to receive the sword, is a faithful portrait. It is full
of what may be called individuality of character. The next illumination
represents the <EM>Duke of Bourbon accepting the challenge</EM>, by
receiving the sword. His countenance is slightly injured. The group of
figures, behind him, is very clever. The ensuing illumination exhibits the
herald offering the Duke de Bourbon the choice of eight coats of armour,
to put on upon the occasion. A still greater injury is here observable in
the countenance of the Duke. The process of conducting the tournay, up to
the moment of the meeting of the combatants, is next detailed; and several
illuminations of the respective armours of the knights and their
attendants, next claim our attention. On the reverse of the xxxijnd, and
on the recto of the xxxiijd leaf, the combat of the two Dukes is
represented. The seats and benches of the spectators are then displayed:
next a very large illumination of the procession of knights and their
attendants to the place of contest. Then follows an interesting one of
banners, coat armours, &amp;c. suspended from buildings--and another, yet
larger and equally interesting, of the entry of the judges.</P>

<P>I am yet in the midst of the emblazoned throng. Look at yonder herald,
with four banners in his hand. It is a curious and imposing sight. Next
succeeds a formal procession--preparing for the combat. It is exceedingly
interesting, and many of the countenances are full of natural expression.
This is followed by a still more magnificent cavalcade, with judges in the
fore-ground; and the "dames et damoiselles," in fair array to the right.
We have next a grand rencontre of the knights attendant--carried on
beneath a balcony of ladies</P>

<P CLASS="poetry">whose bright eyes<BR>
Reign influence, and decide the prize.</P>

<P>These ladies, thus comfortably seated in the raised balcony, wear what
we should now call the <EM>cauchoise</EM> cap. A group of grave judges is
in another balcony, with sundry mottos spread below. In the rencontre
which takes place, the mace seems to be the general instrument of attack
and defence. Splendid as are these illuminations, they yield to those
which follow; especially to that which <EM>immediately</EM> succeeds, and
which displays the preparation for a tournament to be conducted upon a
very large scale. We observe throngs of combatants, and of female
spectators in boxes above. These are rather more delicately touched. Now
comes ... the mixed and stubborn fight of the combatants. They are
desperately engaged with each other; while their martial spirit is raised
to the highest pitch by the sharp and reverberating blasts of the trumpet.
The trumpeters blow their instruments with all their might. Every thing is
in animation, bustle, energy, and confusion. A man's head is cut off, and
extended by an arm, to which--in the position and of the size we
behold--it would be difficult to attach a body. Blood flows copiously on
all sides. The reward of victory is seen in the next and <EM>last</EM>
illumination. The ladies bring the white mantle to throw over the
shoulders of the conqueror. In the whole, there are only lxxiiij. leaves.
This is unquestionably a volume of equal interest and splendor; and, when
it was fresh from the pencil of the illuminator, its effect must have been
exquisite.<A name="fnref_42"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_42">42</A></P>

<P>BOOK OF TOURNAMENTS: No. 8204. 8vo. We have here a sort of miniature
exhibition of the chief circumstances displayed in the previous and larger
MS. It is questionless a very precious book; but has been cruelly cropt.
The text and ornaments are clearly of the end of the fifteenth century;
perhaps about 1470. Nothing can well exceed the brilliancy and power of
many of the illuminations, which are very small and very perfect. The
knight, with a representation of the trefoil, (or what is called club, in
card playing) upon a gold mantle, kills the other with a black star upon a
white mantle. This mortal combat is the last in the book. Each of the
knights, praying before going to combat, is executed with considerable
power of expression. The ladies have the high (cauchoise) cap or bonnet.
The borders, of flowers, are but of secondary merit.</P>

<P>POLYBIUS, <EM>Græcè</EM>. Folio. M. Gail placed before me, in a sly
manner--as if to draw off my attention from the volumes of chivalry just
described,--the present beautiful MS. of Polybius. It is comparatively
recent, being of the very commencement of the sixteenth century: but the
writing exhibits a perfect specimen of that style or form of character
which the Stephenses and Turnebus, &amp;c. appear to have copied in their
respective founts of the Greek letter. It has also other, and perhaps
stronger, claims to notice. The volume belonged to Henry II. and Diane de
Poictiers, and the decorations of the pencil are worthy of the library to
which it was attached. The top ornament, and the initial letter,--at the
beginning of the text--are each executed upon a blue ground, shaded in
brown and gold, in the most exquisitely tasteful manner. This initial
letter has been copied "ad amussim" by old Robert Stephen. Upon the whole,
this is really an enchanting book, whether on the score of writing or of
ornament.</P>

<P>Farewell, now, therefore--to the Collection of MSS. in the
<EM>Bibliothèque du Roi</EM> at Paris. Months and years may be spent among
them, and the vicissitudes of seasons (provided fires were occasionally
introduced) hardly felt. I seem, for the last fortnight, to have lived
entirely in the "olden time;" in a succession of ages from that of Charles
the Bald to that of Henri Quatre: and my eyes have scarcely yet recovered
from the dazzling effects of the illuminator's pencil. "II faut se reposer
un peu."</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER V.</H3>

<P>SOME ACCOUNT OF EARLY PRINTED AND RARE BOOKS IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY.</P>

<P>As the ART of PRINTING rather suddenly, than gradually, checked the
progress of that of writing and illuminating--and as the pressman in
consequence pretty speedily tripped up the heels of the scribe--it will be
a natural and necessary result...that I take you with me to the collection
of PRINTED BOOKS. Accordingly, let us ascend the forementioned lofty
flight of stone steps, and paying attention to the affiche of "wiping our
shoes," let us enter: go straight forward: make our obeisance to Monsieur
Van Praet, and sit down doggedly but joyfully to the glorious
volumes...many of them</P>

<P CLASS="quote">Rough with barbaric gold,</P>

<P>which, through his polite directions, are placed before us. To come to
plain matter of fact. Receive, my good friend, in right earnest and with
the strictest adherence to truth, a list of some of those rarer and more
magnificent productions of the ancient art of printing, which I have been
so many years desirous of inspecting, and which now, for the first time,
present themselves to my notice and admiration. After the respectable
example of M. Van Praet,<A name="fnref_43"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_43">43</A> I shall generally, add the sizes, or measurement<A name=
"fnref_44"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_44">44</A> of the respective
books examined--not so much for the sake of making those unhappy whose
copies are of less capacious dimensions, as for the consolation of those
whose copies may lift up their heads in a yet more aspiring attitude. One
further preliminary remark. I send you this list precisely in the order in
which chance, rather than a preconcerted plan, happened to present the
books to me.</P>

<P>RECUEIL DES HISTOIRES DE TROYE. <EM>Printed by Caxton</EM>. Folio. The
late M. De La Serna Santander, who was Head Librarian of the public
Library at Brussels, purchased this book for the Royal Library for 150
francs.<A name="fnref_45"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_45">45</A> It is
in the finest possible state of preservation; and is bound in red morocco,
with rather a tawdry lining of light blue water-tabby silk.</P>

<P>THE SAME WORK. <EM>Printed by Verard, without date</EM>. Folio. This
copy is UPON VELLUM; in the finest possible condition both for size and
colour. It is printed in Verard's small gothic type, in long lines, with a
very broad margin. The wood-cuts are coloured. The last leaf of the first
book is MS.: containing only sixteen lines upon the recto of the leaf.
This fine copy is bound in red morocco.</P>

<P>HORÆ BEATÆ VIRGINIS, Gr. <EM>Printed by Aldus</EM>. 1497. 12mo. Perhaps
the rarest Aldine volume in the world:--when found in a perfect state. M.
Renouard had not been able to discover a copy to enrich his instructive
annals of the Aldine typography.<A name="fnref_46"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_46">46</A> The present copy is four inches and five eighths, by
three inches and a half. It is in its original clasp binding, with stamped
leather-outsides.<A name="fnref_47"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_47">47</A></P>

<P>THE SHYPPE OF FOOLES. <EM>Printed by Wynkyn de Worde</EM>. 1509. 8vo.
At length this far-famed and long talked of volume has been examined. It
is doubtless a prodigious curiosity, and unique--inasmuch as this copy is
UPON VELLUM. The vellum is stout but soft. I suspect this copy to be
rather cropt. It is bound in red morocco, and is perfectly clean and sound
throughout.</P>

<P>ROMAN DE JASON. In French. <EM>Printed by Caxton</EM>. Folio. A little
history is attached to the acquisition of this book, which may be worth
recital. An unknown, and I may add an unknowing, person, bought this most
exceedingly rare volume, with the <EM>Qudriloge of Alain Chartier</EM>,
1477, Folio, in one and the same ancient wooden binding, for the
marvellously moderate sum of--<EM>one louis</EM>! The purchaser brought
the volume to M. de La Serna Santander, and asked him if he thought
<EM>two</EM> louis too much for their value. That wary Bibliographer only
replied, "I do not think it is." He became the purchaser; and instantly
and generously consigned the volumes to their present place of
destination.<A name="fnref_48"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_48">48</A>
You may remember that the collection of Anthony Storer, in the library of
Eton College, also possesses this book--at present wanting in Lord
Spencer's library. The present copy contains one hundred and thirty-two
leaves, including a blank leaf; and is in a perfect state of
preservation.</P>

<P>PSALTERIUM, Latinè. <EM>Printed by Fust and Schoiffher</EM>. 1457.
Folio. EDITIO PRINCEPS. This celebrated volume is a recent acquisition. It
was formerly the copy of Girardot de Préfond, and latterly that of Count
M'Carthy; at whose sale it was bought for 12,000 francs. It is cruelly
cropt, especially at the side margins; and is of too sombre and sallow a
tint. Measurement--fourteen inches, by nine and a half. It is doubtless an
absolutely necessary volume in a collection like the present. Only SEVEN
known copies in the world.</P>

<P>PSALTERIUM, Latinè. <EM>Printed by the same</EM>. 1459: Folio.
<EM>Editio Secunda</EM>. The first six leaves have been evidently much
thumbed; and the copy, from the appearance of the first leaf alone, is as
evidently cropt. For the colophon, both of this and of the preceding
edition, examine the catalogue of Lord Spencer's library.<A name=
"fnref_49"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_49">49</A> Upon the whole, it
strikes me, as far as recollection may serve, that his Lordship's copy of
each edition is preferable to those under consideration.<A name=
"fnref_50"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_50">50</A> This copy measures
sixteen inches and a quarter, by twelve and one-eighth.</P>

<P>PSALTERIUM, Latinè. <EM>Printed by Schoiffher</EM>. 1490. Folio. A
magnificent volume: and what renders it still more desirable, it is
printed UPON VELLUM. Lord Spencer's copy is upon paper. The
<EM>previous</EM> editions are <EM>always</EM> found upon vellum. Fine and
imposing as is the copy before me, it is nevertheless evident--from the
mutilated ancient numerals at top--that it has been somewhat cropt. This
fine book measures sixteen inches and five eighths, by eleven inches and
seven eighths.</P>

<P>PSALTERIUM, Latinè. <EM>Printed by Schoiffher</EM>. 1502. Folio. This
book (wanting in the cabinet at St. James's Place) is upon paper. As far
as folio Cxxxvij. the leaves are numbered: afterwards, the printed
numerals cease. A ms. note, in the first leaf, says, that the text of the
first sixteen leaves precisely follows that of the first edition of 1457.
The present volume will be always held dear in the estimation of the
typographical antiquary. It is THE LAST in which the name of <EM>Peter
Schoiffher</EM>, the son-in-law of Fust, appears to have been introduced.
That printer died probably a short time afterwards. It measures fifteen
inches and one eighth in height, by ten inches and seven eighths in
width.</P>

<P>PSALTERIUM, Latinè. <EM>Printed by Schoiffher's Son</EM>. 1516. Folio.
A fine and desirable copy, printed UPON VELLUM. It is tolerably fair:
measuring fifteen inches, by ten inches and three quarters.</P>

<P>I have little hesitation in estimating <EM>these five copies</EM> of
the earlier editions of the Psalter, to be worth, at least, one thousand
pounds.</P>

<P>BIBLIA LATINA. (<EM>Supposed to have been printed in 1455.)</EM> Folio.
This is the famous edition called the MAZARINE BIBLE, from the first known
copy of it having been discovered in the library of that Cardinal, in the
college founded by himself. Bibliography has nearly exhausted itself in
disquisitions upon it. But this copy--which is upon paper--is THE COPY
<EM>of all copies</EM>; inasmuch as it contains the memorable inscription,
or coeval ms. memorandum, of its having been illuminated in 1456.<A name=
"fnref_51"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_51">51</A> In the first volume,
this inscription occurs at the end of the printed text, in three short
lines, but to the best of my recollection, the memorandum resembles the
printed text rather more than the fac-simile of it formerly published by
me. In the second volume, this inscription is in three long lines and is
well enough copied in the M'Carthy catalogue. It may be as well to give
you a transcript of this celebrated memorandum, as it proves
unquestionably the impression to have been executed before any known
volume with a printed date. It is taken from the end of the second
volume.<A name="fnref_52"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_52">52</A></P>

<P>THE SAME EDITION.--This is a sound and desirable copy, printed UPON
VELLUM; but much inferior in every respect, to another similar copy in the
possession of Messrs. G. and W. Nicol, booksellers to his Majesty.<A name=
"fnref_53"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_53">53</A> It measures fifteen
inches and three-fourths, by nearly eleven and six eighths.</P>

<P>BIBLIA LATINA. <EM>Printed by Pfister, at Bamberg</EM>. Folio. Three
volumes. The rarest of all Latin Bibles, when found in a perfect state.
This was Lord Oxford's copy, and is not to be equalled for its beauty and
soundness of condition. What renders it precious and unique, is an
undoubted coeval ms. date, in red ink, of 1461. Some of the leaves in the
first volume are wholly uncut. It is in handsome, substantial russia
binding.</P>

<P>DURANDI RATIONALE DIV. OFF. <EM>Printed by Fust and Schoiffher</EM>.
1459. Folio. Here are not fewer than <EM>three</EM> copies of this early,
and much coveted volume: all of course UPON VELLUM. The tallest of them
measures sixteen inches and a half, by twelve and one eighth; and is in
red morocco binding.</P>

<P>BIBLIA GERMANICA. <EM>Supposed to be printed by Mentelin</EM>.
<EM>Without date</EM>. Folio. If we except the earlier leaves--of which
the first is in ms., upon vellum, and the three succeeding, which are a
little tender and soiled--this is a very fine copy; so large, as to have
many bottom rough margins. At the end of the second volume an ancient ms.
memorandum absurdly assigns the printing of this edition to Fust, and its
date to 1472. The paper of this impression is certainly not very unlike
that of the <EM>Catholicon</EM> of 1460.</P>

<P>BIBLIA PAUPERUM. A block-book. This is a cropt, but clean and
uncoloured copy. I suspect, however, that it has been washed in some
parts. It is in red morocco binding.</P>

<P>BIBLIA POLONICA. 1563. Folio. This is the famous Protestant Polish
Bible, put forth under the patronage of Prince Radziwill; and concerning
which a good deal has been already submitted to the public attention.<A
name="fnref_54"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_54">54</A> But the copy
under consideration was a <EM>presentation</EM> copy from a descendant of
Prince Radziwill--to the public Library of Sedan, to be there deposited
through the intervention of Lord James Russell; as the following
memorandum, in the Prince's own hand writing, attests: "<EM>Hoc sacrarum
Literarum Veteris Nouique Testamenti opus, fidelissima Cura Maiorum meorum
vetustis Typis Polonicis excusum, In Bibliothecam Sedanensem per Nobilem
Virum Dominum Jacobum Russelium, Ill<SUP>mi</SUP> Principis Friderici
Mauritii Bullionei ad me exlegatum inferendum committo</EM>.</P>

<P><EM>H. Radziwill</EM>."</P>

<P>It is nevertheless an imperfect copy, as it wants the title-page. M.
Van Praet thinks it otherwise complete, but I suspect that it is not
so.</P>

<P>BIBLIA SCLAVONICA; 1587. Folio. Of this exceedingly scarce volume--
which M. Van Praet placed before me as almost unique--the present is a
fine and desirable copy: in its original binding--with a stamped ornament
of the Crucifixion on each side. One of these ornaments is quite perfect:
the other is somewhat injured.</P>

<P>BIBLIA BOHEMICA. <EM>Printed in 1488</EM>. Folio. Among the rarest of
the early-printed versions of the sacred text: and this copy happens to be
a most beautiful and desirable one. It is wanting in Lord Spencer's
collection; which renders a minute description of it the more desirable.
The first signature, <EM>a i</EM>, appears to be blank. On <EM>a ii</EM>
begins a prologue or prefatory proheme, ending on the reverse of <EM>a
vj</EM>. It has a prefix, or title, in fifteen lines, printed in red. The
text is uniformly printed in double columns, in a sharp secretary-gothic
character, with ink sufficiently black, upon paper not remarkably stout,
but well manufactured. There are running titles, throughout. The last
eight leaves upon signature <EM>i</EM> are printed in red and black lines
alternately, and appear to be an index. The colophon, in nineteen lines,
is at the bottom of the second column, on the reverse of <EM>mm viij</EM>.
This book is thought to have been printed at <EM>Prague</EM>. The present
copy is bound in blue morocco.</P>

<P>NEW TESTAMENT: <EM>in the Dutch and Russian languages</EM>. This
volume, which is considered to be unique, and of which indeed I never saw,
or heard of, another copy, bears the imprint of "<EM>'T
Gravenhage--Iohannes Van Duren, Boecverkoper</EM>. MDCCXVII." Folio. The
Dutch text is uniformly printed in capital letters; the Russian, in what I
conceive to be lowercase, and about two-thirds the size of the Dutch.</P>

<P>The cause of the scarcity of perfect copies is, that very nearly the
whole of the impression was <EM>lost at sea</EM>. The present copy
undoubtedly affords decided demonstrations of a marine soaking: parts of
it being in the most piteous condition. The first volume contains 255
leaves: the second, 196 leaves. The copy is yet in boards, in the most
tender condition. M. Van Praet thinks it <EM>just</EM> possible that there
may be a <EM>second</EM> similar copy. The <EM>third</EM> (if there be a
second) is known to have perished in the flames at Moscow.</P>

<P>THE PENTATEUCH: <EM>in Hebrew</EM>. <EM>Printed in 1491</EM>.
<EM>Folio</EM>. A very fine copy, printed UPON VELLUM. The press work has
a rich and black appearance; but the vellum is rather soiled. One leaf
presents us with the recto covered by ms. of a brown tint--and the reverse
covered by printed text. The last page is certainly ms. This however is a
rare and costly tome.</P>

<P>TRACTS PRINTED BY PFISTER, <EM>at Bamberg</EM>; Folio. This is really a
matchless volume, on the score of rarity and curiosity. It begins with a
tract, or moral treatise, upon death. The wood cuts, five in number, are
very large, filling nearly the whole page. One of them presents us with
death upon a white horse; and the other was immediately recognised by me,
as being the identical subject of which a fac-simile of a portion is given
to the public in Lord Spencer's Catalogue<A name="fnref_55"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_55">55</A>--but which, at that time, I was unable to
appropriate. This tract contains twenty-four leaves, having twenty-eight
lines in a full page. In all probability it was the <EM>first</EM> of the
tracts printed by Pfister in the present volume. The FOUR HISTORIES, so
fully detailed in the work just referred to, immediately follow. This is
of the date of 1462. Then the BIBLIA PAUPERUM, also fully described in the
same work. This treatise is without date, and contains seventeen leaves;
with a profusion of wood cuts, of which fac-similes have been given by me
to the public. These three copies are in remarkably fine preservation; and
this volume will be always highly treasured in the estimation of the
typographical antiquary. The Latin Bible, by Pfister, has been just
described to you. There was a yet MORE PRECIOUS typographical gem ... in
this very library; by the same printer--with very curious wood cuts,--of
one of which Heineken has indulged us with a fac-simile. I mean the FABLES
... with the express date of 1461. But recent events have caused it to be
restored to its original quarters.<A name="fnref_56"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_56">56</A></P>

<P>LACTANTII INSTITUTIONES, &amp;C. <EM>Printed in the Soubiaco
Monastery</EM>. 1465. Folio. This was Lord Oxford's copy, and may be
called almost uncut. You are to learn, that copies of this beautifully
printed book are by no means very uncommon--although formerly, if I
remember rightly, De Bure knew but of one copy in France--but copies in a
fine state, and of such dimensions as are Mr. Grenville's and the one now
before me, must be considered as of extremely rare occurrence. This copy
measures thirteen inches, one-eighth, and one-sixteenth--by very nearly
nine inches one-eighth. You will smile at this particularity; but depend
upon it there are ruler-carrying collectors who will thank me heartily for
such a rigidly minute measurement.</P>

<P>STS. AUGUSTINUS DE CIVITATE DEI. <EM>Printed in the Soubiaco
Monastery</EM>. 1467. Folio. It always does the heart of a bibliographer
good to gaze upon a fine copy of this resplendent volume. It is truly
among the master-pieces of early printing: but what will be your notions
of the copy NOW under description, when I tell you, not only that it once
belonged to our beloved FRANCIS I., but that, for amplitude and condition,
it rivals the copy in the library at <EM>St. James's Place</EM>? In short,
it was precisely between <EM>this very copy</EM>, and that of my Lord
Spencer, that M. Van Praet paused--("J'ai balancé" were, I think, the
words used to me by that knowing bibliographer) and pondered and hesitated
... again and again ... ere he could decide upon which of the two was to
be parted with! But, supposing the size and condition of each to be fairly
"balanced" against the other, M. Van Praet could not, in honour and
conscience, surrender the copy which had been formerly in the library of
one of the greatest of the French monarchs ... and so the spirit of
Francis I. rests in peace ... as far as the retention of this copy may
contribute to its repose. It is doubtless more brilliant and more
attractive than Lord Spencer's--which, however, has no equal on the
<EM>other</EM> side of the channel: but it is more beaten, and I suspect,
somewhat more cropt. I forgot to say, that there are several capital
initials in this copy tolerably well illuminated, apparently of the time
of Francis--who, I am persuaded, loved illuminators of books to his
heart.</P>

<P>I shall now continue literally as I began:--without any regard to
dates, or places where printed.</P>

<P>CATHOLICON. <EM>Printed by Gutenburg</EM>: 1460. Folio. 2 vols. This
copy is UPON VELLUM; but yet much inferior to the absolutely unrivalled
membranaceous copy in Mr. Grenville's precious library. This copy measures
fifteen inches one eighth, by eleven inches one eighth. It is bound in red
morocco.</P>

<P>GRAMMATICA RHYTHMICA. <EM>Printed by Fust and Schoiffher</EM>; 1466.
Folio. How you would start back with surprise--peradventure mingled with
indignation--to be told that, for this very meagre little folio, somewhat
cropt, consisting but of eleven leaves cruelly scribbled upon ... not
fewer than <EM>three thousand three hundred livres</EM> were given--at the
sale of Cardinal Lomenie's library, about thirty years ago! It is even so.
And wherefore? Because only <EM>one</EM> other copy of it is known:--and
that "other" is luckily reposing upon the mahogany shelves in St. James's
Place. The present copy measures ten inches seven eighths, by eight
inches.</P>

<P>VOCABULARIUS. <EM>Printed by Bechtermuntze</EM>; 1467. Quarto. EDITIO
PRINCEPS--one of the rarest books in the world. Indeed I apprehend this
copy to be absolutely UNIQUE. This work is a Latin and German Vocabulary,
of which a good notion may be formed by the account of the <EM>second</EM>
edition of it, in 1469, in a certain descriptive catalogue.<A name=
"fnref_57"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_57">57</A> To be perfect, there
should be 215 leaves. A full page has thirty-five lines. This copy is in
as fine, clean, and crackling condition, as is that of Lord Spencer of the
second impression. It is eight inches and a half in height, by five inches
and five eighths in width.</P>

<P>HARTLIEB'S BOOK OF CHIROMANCY. <EM>Supposed to have been printed with
wooden blocks</EM>. Folio. You may remember the amusement which you said
was afforded you by the account of, and the fac-similes from, this very
strange and bizarre production--in the <EM>Bibliographical Decameron</EM>.
The copy before me is much larger and finer than that in Lord Spencer's
collection. The figure of the Doctor and of the Princess Anna are also
much clearer in their respective impressions; and the latter has really no
very remote resemblance to what is given in the <EM>Bibl.
Spenceriana</EM><A name="fnref_58"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_58">58</A> of one of the Queens of Hungary. If so, perhaps the period
of its execution may not be quite so remote as is generally imagined: for
the Hungarian Chronicle, from which that regal figure was taken, is of the
date of 1485.</P>

<P>HISTORIA BEATÆ VIRGINIS. <EM>Without date</EM>. This is doubtless
rather an extraordinary volume. The text is printed only on one side of
the leaf: so as to leave, alternately, the reverses and rectos
blank--facing each other. But this <EM>alone</EM> is no proof of its
antiquity; for, from the character both of the wood cuts and the type, I
am quite persuaded that this volume could not have been executed much
before the year 1480. It is not improbable that this book might have been
printed at <EM>Ulm</EM>. It is a very beautiful copy, and bound in blue
morocco.</P>

<P>VIRGILIUS. <EM>Printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz</EM>. 1469. Folio.
EDITIO PRINCEPS. The enormous worth and rarity of this exceedingly
precious volume may be estimated from this very copy having been
purchased, at the sale of the Duke de la Valliere's library, in 1783, for
four thousand one hundred and one livres. The first leaf of the
<EM>Bucolics</EM>, of which the margin of the page is surrounded by an
ancient illumination, gives unfortunate evidence of the binding of
Chamot.<A name="fnref_59"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_59">59</A> In
other words, this copy, although in other respects white and sound, has
been too much cropt. It measures eleven inches and six eighths, by nearly
seven inches and five eighths.</P>

<P>VIRGILIUS. <EM>Printed by Vindelin de Spira</EM>. 1470. Here are not
fewer than <EM>two</EM> delicious copies of this exceedingly rare
impression--and the most delicious happens to be UPON VELLUM. "O rare
felicity!... (you exclaim) to spend so many hours within scarcely more
than an arm's length of such cherished and long-sought after treasures!"
But it is true nevertheless. The vellum copy demands our more immediate
attention. It is very rarely, indeed, that this volume can be obtained in
any state, whether upon vellum or paper;<A name="fnref_60"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_60">60</A> but in the condition in which it is here
found, it is a very precious acquisition. Some few leaves are a little
tawny or foxy, and the top of the very first page makes it manifest that
the volume has suffered a slight degree of amputation. But such defects
are only as specks upon the sun's disk. This copy, bound in old yellow
morocco binding of the Gaignat period, measures very nearly twelve inches
and three quarters, by eight inches and five eighths.</P>

<P>The SAME EDITION. A copy upon paper: in the most unusual condition. The
pages are numbered with a pen, rather neatly: but these numerals had
better have been away. A frightful (gratuitous) ms. title--copied in a
modern hand, from another of the date of 1474--strikes us; on opening the
volume, in a very disagreeable manner. At top we read "<EM>Ad usum H.D.
Henrici E.C.M.C.</EM>" The first page of the text is surrounded by an old
illumination: and the title to the Bucolics is inserted, by the hand, in
gold capital letters. From the impression appearing on the six following
leaves, it should seem that this illuminated border had been stamped,
after the book was bound. The condition of this classical treasure may be
pronounced, upon the whole, to be equally beautiful and desirable. Perhaps
there has been the slightest possible cropping; as the ancient ms.
numerals are occasionally somewhat invisible. However, this is a most
lovely book: measuring thirteen inches and one quarter, in height, by nine
inches and very nearly one quarter in width.</P>

<P>VIRGILIUS. <EM>Printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz</EM>. 1471. Folio.
SECOND ROMAN EDITION; of yet greater scarcity than the first. This was
Politian's own copy, and is so large as to be almost <EM>uncut</EM>:
having the margins filled with Scholia, and critical observations, in
almost the smallest hand-writing to be met with: supposed to be also from
the pen of Politian. The autograph and subscription of that eminent
scholar meet our eye at the top of the very first fly leaf.</P>

<P>Of all ancient editions of Virgil, this is probably not only the most
estimable, but is so scarce as to have been, till lately, perfectly
unknown. According to the ancient ms. numerals in this copy, there should
be 225 leaves--to render the volume perfect. In our own country, it
is--with a sigh I speak it!--only to be found (and <EM>that</EM>, in an
<EM>imperfect</EM> state) in the library of Dr. Wm. Hunter at Glasgow.<A
name="fnref_61"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_61">61</A> This invaluable
volume is preserved in good, sound, characteristic old binding.</P>

<P>VIRGILIUS. <EM>Printed by Ghering</EM>. 1478. <EM>Quarto</EM>. This
impression is perhaps rather rare than valuable; although I am free to
admit it is yet a desideratum in the Spencerian collection. It commences
with an address by the famous Beroaldus to I. Francus, his pupil, on the
reverse of the first leaf--in which the tutor expresses his admiration of
Virgil in the following manner: "te amantissime mi Johannes hortor, te
moneo, et si pateris oro, ut VIRGILIUM lectites. Virgilio inhies: Illum
colas; illum dies noctesque decãtes. Ille sit semper in manibus. Et ut
præceptoris fungar officio, illud potissimum tibi pecipiã et repetens
iterumque iterumque monebo: ut humanitatis studia ac mãsuetiores musas

(handsome) fount of roman type, upon very thick paper.<A name=
"fnref_62"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_62">62</A> The present copy,
although apparently cropt, is sound and desirable.</P>

<P>PLINII HIST. NATURALIS. <EM>Printed by J. de Spira</EM>. 1469. Folio.
EDITIO PRINCEPS:--but oh,! marvellous specimen--a copy UPON VELLUM! Fair
is the colour and soft is the texture of this exquisite production--bound
in two volumes. I examined both volumes thoroughly, and am not sure that I
discovered what might be fairly called one discoloured leaf. It is with
equal pain and difficulty that one withdraws one's eyes from such a
beautiful book-gem. This copy measures fifteen inches and a half, by ten
inches and three-eighths.</P>

<P>The SAME EDITION. Upon paper. A remarkably fine copy: well beaten
however--and, I should be loth to assert positively, not free from some
washing--for the ancient red numerals, introduced by the pencil of the
rubricator, and designating the several books and chapters, seem to have
faded and been retouched. I observe also, that some of the ancient
illuminated letters, which had probably faded during the process of
washing or cleaning, have been retouched, and even painted
afresh--especially in the blue back-grounds. The first page is prettily
illuminated; but there are slight indications of the worm at the end of
the volume. Upon the whole, however, this is a magnificent book, and
inferior only to Lord Spencer's unrivalled copy--upon paper. It measures
sixteen inches and five eighths, by eleven inches and one sixteenth, and
is handsomely bound in red morocco.</P>

<P>PLINII HISTORIA NATURALIS. <EM>Printed by Jenson</EM>, 1472. Folio. A
copy UPON VELLUM: but, upon the whole, I was disappointed in the size and
condition of this book. The vellum has not had justice done to it in the
binding, being in parts crumpled. The first page is however beautifully
illuminated. This copy measures sixteen inches, by ten and three
eighths.</P>

<P>PLINII HIST. NAT. Italicè. <EM>Printed by Jenson</EM>. 1476. Folio. A
copy UPON VELLUM. About the first forty leaves are cruelly stained at top.
The last eight or ten leaves are almost of a yellow tint. In other parts,
where the vellum is white, (for it is of a remarkably fine quality)
nothing can exceed the beauty of this book: but it has been, I suspect,
very severely cropt--if an opinion may be formed from its companion upon
paper, about to be described. It is fifteen inches in height, by ten and a
quarter in width.</P>

<P>THE SAME EDITION. <EM>Printed by the same Printer</EM>. I suspect this
to be perhaps the finest paper copy in the world: as perfect as Lord
Spencer's copy of the first edition of the same author. Every thing
breathes of its pristine condition: the colour and the substance of the
paper: the width of the margin, and the purity of the embellishments:<A
name="fnref_63"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_63">63</A> This copy will
also serve to convince the most obstinate, that, when one catches more
than a glimpse of the ms. numerals at top, and ms. signatures at bottom,
one has hopes of possessing the book in its primitive plenitude. It is
sixteen inches and three quarters in height, by nearly eleven inches and a
quarter in width.</P>

<P>LIVIUS. <EM>Printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz</EM>. 1469. Folio. EDITIO
PRINCEPS. A fine copy, in three thin volumes. The margins, however, are
not free from ms. notes, and there are palpable evidences of a slight
truncation. Yet it is a fine copy: measuring fifteen inches and very
nearly three quarters, by eleven inches one eighth. In red morocco
binding.</P>

<P>LIVIUS. <EM>Printed by Ulric Han</EM>. <EM>Without Date</EM>. Folio. In
three thin volumes. A large copy, but evidently much washed, from the
faint appearance of the marginal notes. Some leaves are very
bad--especially the earlier ones of the preface and the text. The latter,
however, have a very pretty ancient illumination. This copy measures
fifteen inches five eighths, by ten seven eighths.<A name=
"fnref_64"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_64">64</A></P>

<P>LIVIUS. <EM>Printed by Vindelin de Spira</EM>. 1470. Fol. A magnificent
copy, in two volumes: much preferable to either of the preceding. The
first page of text has a fine old illumination. It is clean and sound
throughout: measuring fifteen inches five eighths, by eleven
inches--within an eighth.</P>

<P>THE SAME EDITION. Printed UPON VELLUM. This copy, if I remember
rightly, is considered to be unique.<A name="fnref_65"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_65">65</A> It is that which was formerly preserved in
the public library at Lyons, and had been lent to the late Duke de la
Vallière during his life only--to enrich his book-shelves--having been
restored to its original place of destination upon the death of the Duke.
It is both in an imperfect and lacerated condition: the latter, owing to a
cannon ball, which struck it during the siege of Lyons. The first volume,
which begins abruptly thus: "ex parte altera ripe, &amp;c." is a beautiful
book; the vellum being of a uniform, but rather yellow tint. It measures
fourteen inches five eighths, by nine and six eighths. The second volume
makes a kind-hearted bibliographer shudder. The cannon ball took it
obliquely, so as to leave the first part of the volume less lacerated than
the latter. In the latter part, however, the direction of the destructive
weapon went, capriciously enough, across the page. This second volume yet
exhibits a fine old illumination on the first page.</P>

<P>LIVIUS. <EM>Printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz</EM>. 1472. Fol. 2 vols.
A fine copy, and larger than either of the preceding: but the beginning of
the first volume and the conclusion of the second are slightly wormed.
There is a duplicate leaf of the beginning of the text, which is rather
brown, but illuminated in the ancient manner. This copy measures fifteen
inches and a half, by eleven one eighth.</P>

<P>Let me now vary the bibliographical theme, by the mention of a few
copies of works of a miscellaneous but not unamusing character. And first,
for a small cluster of CAXTONS and MACHLINIAS.</P>

<P>TULLY OF OLD AGE, &amp;C. <EM>Printed by Caxton</EM>, 1481. A cropt and
soiled copy; whereas copies of this Caxtonian production are usually in a
clean and sound condition. The binding is infinitely too gaudy for the
state of the interior. It appears to want the treatise upon Friendship.
This book once belonged to William Burton the Leicestershire historian; as
we learn from this inscription below the colophon: "<EM>Liber Willmi
Burton Lindliaci Leicestrensis socij inter. Templi, ex dono amici mei
singularis M<SUP>ri</SUP>. Iohãnis Price, socij Interioris. Templi, 28.
Jan. 1606. Anno regni regis Iacobi quarto</EM>." On the reverse is a
fac-simile of the same subscription, beneath an exceedingly well executed
head of Burton, in pen and ink.</P>

<P>ART AND CRAFTE TO KNOW WELL TO DYE. <EM>Printed by Caxton</EM>. 1490.
Folio. This book was sold to the Royal Library of France, many years ago,
by Mr. Payne, for the moderate sum of £10. 10s. It is among the rarest of
the volumes from the press of Caxton. Every leaf of this copy exhibits
proof of the skill and care of Roger Payne; for every leaf is inlaid and
mounted, with four lines of red ink round each page--not perhaps in the
very best taste. The copy is also cramped or choked in the back.</P>

<P>STATUTES OF RICHARD III. <EM>Printed by Machlinia</EM>. Folio.
<EM>Without Date</EM>. A perfect copy for size and condition; but the
binding is much too gay. I refer you to the Typographical Antiquities<A
name="fnref_66"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_66">66</A> for an account
of this edition:</P>

<P>NOVA STATUTA. <EM>Printed by the Same</EM>. Folio. You must examine the
pages last referred to, for a description of this elaborately executed
volume; printed upon paper of an admirable quality. The present is a
sound, clean, and desirable copy: but why in such gay, red morocco,
binding?</P>

<P>LIBER MODORUM SIGNIFICANDI. <EM>Printed at St. Alban's</EM>; 1480.
Quarto. The only copy of this rare volume I have ever seen. It appears to
be bound in what is called the old Oxford binding, and the text is
preceded by a considerable quantity of old coeval ms. relating to the
science of arithmetic. A full page has thirty-two lines.</P>

<P>The signatures <EM>a</EM>, <EM>b</EM>, <EM>c</EM>, <EM>d</EM>,
<EM>e</EM>, run in eights: <EM>f</EM> has six leaves. On the recto of
<EM>f</EM> vj is the colophon:</P>

<P>This copy had belonged successively to Tutet and Wodhull. A ms.
treatise, in a later hand, concludes the volume. The present is a sound
and desirable copy.</P>

<P>BOCCACCIO. IL DECAMERONE. <EM>Printed by Valdarfer</EM>. 1471. Folio.
This is the famous edition about which all the Journals of Europe have
recently "rung from side to side." But it wants much in value of THE yet
more famous COPY<A name="fnref_67"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_67">67</A> which was sold at the sale of the Duke of Roxburghe's
library; inasmuch as it is defective in the first leaf of the text, and
three leaves of the table. In the whole, according to the comparatively
recent numerals, there are 265 leaves. This copy measures eleven inches
and a half, by seven inches and seven eighths. It is bound in red morocco,
with inside marble leaves.</P>

<P>THE SAME WORK. <EM>Printed by P. Adam de Michaelibus</EM>.
<EM>Mantua</EM>, 1472. An edition of almost equal rarity with the
preceding; and of which, I suspect, there is only one perfect copy (at
Blenheim) in our own country.</P>

<P>The table contains seven leaves; and the text, according to the numbers
of this copy, has 256 leaves. A full page has forty-one lines. The present
is a sound, genuine copy; measuring, exclusively of the cover, twelve
inches three eighths, by eight seven eighths.</P>

<P>BOCCACE. RUINES DES NOBLES HOMMES &amp; FEMMES. <EM>Printed by Colard
Mansion, at Bruges</EM>. 1476. Folio. This edition is printed in double
columns, in Mansion's larger type, precisely similar to what has been
published in the Bibliotheca Spenceriana.<A name="fnref_68"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_68">68</A> The title is in red--with a considerable
space below, before the commencement of the text, as if this vacuum were
to be supplied by the pencil of the illuminator. The present is a
remarkably fine copy. The colophon is in six lines.</P>

<P>FAIT DE LA GUERRE. <EM>Printed by Colard Mansion</EM>. <EM>Without
Date</EM>. Folio. This rare book is printed in a very different type from
that usually known as the type of Colard Mansion: being smaller and
closer--but decidedly gothic. A full page has thirty-two lines. There are
neither numerals, signatures, nor catchwords. On the recto of the
twenty-ninth and last leaf, we read</P>

<P CLASS="quote"><STRONG>Impressum brugis per Colardum
Mansion.</STRONG></P>

<P>The reverse is blank. This is a fine genuine copy, in red morocco
binding.</P>

<P>LASCARIS GRAMMATICA GRÆCA. 1476. Quarto. The first book printed in the
Greek language; and, as such, greatly sought after by the curious. This is
a clean, neat copy, but I suspect a little washed and cropt. Nevertheless,
it is a most desirable volume.<A name="fnref_69"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_69">69</A></P>

<P>AULUS GELLIUS. <EM>Printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz</EM>. 1469. Folio.
Editio Princeps. A sound and rather fine copy: almost the whole of the old
ms. numerals at top remaining. It is very slightly wormed at the
beginning. This copy measures thirteen inches by nine.</P>

<P>CÆSAR. <EM>Printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz</EM>. 1469. Folio. Editio
Princeps: with ms. notes by Victorius. A large sound copy, but the first
few leaves are soiled or rather thumbed. The marginal edges are apparently
uncut. It measures twelve inches seven eighths by nine inches one
eighth.</P>

<P>APULEIUS. <EM>Printed by the Same</EM>. 1469. Folio. Editio Princeps.
All these FIRST EDITIONS are of considerable rarity. The present copy is,
upon the whole, large and sound: though not free from marginal notes and
stains. The first few leaves at top are slightly injured. It measures
thirteen inches one eighth, by nine inches.<A name="fnref_70"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_70">70</A></P>

<P>AUSONIUS. 1472. Folio: with all the accompanying pieces.<A name=
"fnref_71"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_71">71</A> Editio Princeps; and
undoubtedly much rarer than either of the preceding volumes. Of the
present copy, the first few leaves are wormed in the centre, and a little
stained. The first illuminated leaf of the text is stained; so is the
second leaf, not illuminated. In the whole, eighty-six leaves. The latter
leaves are wormed. This copy is evidently cropt.</P>

<P>CATULLUS, TIBULLUS &amp; PROPERTIUS. 1472. Folio. Editio Princeps. Of
equal, if not greater, rarity than even the Ausonius. This is a sound and
very desirable copy--displaying the ancient ms. signatures. The edges of
the leaves are rather of a foxy tint. After the Catullus, a blank leaf.
This copy measures eleven inches one eighth, by very nearly seven inches
five eighths.</P>

<P>HOMERI OPERA. Gr. 1488. Folio. Editio Princeps. When you are informed
that this copy is ... UNCUT ... you will necessarily figure to yourself a
volume of magnificent, as well as pristine, dimensions. Yet, without
putting on spectacles, one discovers occasionally a few foxy spots towards
the edges; and the first few leaves are perhaps somewhat tawny. Upon the
whole, however, the condition is wonderful: and I am almost ashamed of
myself at having talked about foxy spots and tawny tints. This copy is
bound in red morocco, in a sensible, unassuming manner. For the comfort of
such, whose copies aspire to the distinction of being <EM>almost</EM>
uncut, I add, that this volume measures fourteen inches, by about nine
inches and five eighths.</P>

<P>HOMERI OPERA. Gr. 1808. <EM>Printed by Bodoni</EM>. Folio. 2 volumes.
This grand copy is printed UPON VELLUM, and is the presentation copy to
Bonaparte--to whom this edition was dedicated, by Bodoni.<A name=
"fnref_72"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_72">72</A> Splendid, large, and
beautiful, as is this typographical performance, I must candidly own that
there is something about it which "likes me not." The vellum, however
choice, and culled by Bodoni's most experienced foragers, is, to my eye,
too white--which arises perhaps from the text occupying so comparatively
small a space in the page. Nor is the type pleasing to my taste. It is too
cursive and sparkling; and the upper strokes are uniformly too thin. In
short, the whole has a cold effect. However, this is questionless one of
the most magnificent productions of the modern press. The volumes measure
two feet in length.</P>

<P>CRONIQUES DE FRANCE. <EM>Printed by Verard</EM>. 1493. Folio. Three
vols. A glorious copy--printed UPON VELLUM! The wood-cuts are coloured. It
is bound in red morocco.</P>

<P>LAUNCELOT DU LAC. <EM>Printed by Verard</EM>. 1494. Folio. 3 vols. Also
UPON VELLUM. In red morocco binding. There is yet another copy of the same
date, upon vellum, but with different illuminations: equally magnificent
and covetable. In red morocco binding.</P>

<P>GYRON LE COURTOYS: auecques la devise des armes de tous les cheualiers
de la table ronde. <EM>Printed by Verard</EM>. <EM>Without Date</EM>.
Folio. Printed UPON VELLUM. This was once a fine thumping fellow of a
copy!--but it has lost somewhat of its stature by the knife of the
binder--or rather from the destruction of the Library of St. Germain des
Près: whence it was thrown into the streets, and found next day by M. Van
Praet. Many of the books, from the same library, were thrown into cellars.
It is evident, from the larger illuminations, and especially from the
fourth, on the recto of <EM>d vj</EM>, that this volume has suffered in
the process of binding. In old blue morocco.</P>

<P>ROMAN DE LA ROSE. <EM>Printed by Verard</EM>. <EM>Without Date</EM>.
Small folio. In double columns, in prose. This superbly bound volume--once
the property of H. Durfé, having his arms in the centre, and corner
embellishments, in metal, on which are the entwined initials T.C.--is but
an indifferent copy. It is printed UPON VELLUM; and has been, as I
suspect, rather cruelly cropt in the binding. Much of the vellum is also
crumpled and tawny.</P>

<P>L'HORLOGE DE SAPIENCE. <EM>Printed by Verard</EM>. 1493. Folio. One of
the loveliest books ever opened, and printed UPON VELLUM. Every thing is
here perfect. The page is finely proportioned, the vellum is exceedingly
beautiful, and the illuminations have a brilliance and delicacy of finish
not usually seen in volumes of this kind. The borders are decorated by the
pencil, and the second may be considered quite perfect of its kind. This
book is bound by Bradel l'Ainé.</P>

<P>MILLES ET AMYS. <EM>Printed by Verard</EM>. <EM>Without Date</EM>.
Folio. A copy UPON VELLUM. From the same library as the copy of the Roman
de la Rose, just described; and in the same style of binding. It is kept
in the same case; but, although cropt, it is a much finer book. The cuts
are coloured, and the text is printed in double columns. I do not at this
present moment remember to have seen another copy of this edition of the
work.</P>

<P>IEU DES ESCHEZ. <EM>Without name of Printer (but probably by Verard) or
Date</EM>. Folio.<A name="fnref_73"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_73">73</A> This is one of the numerous French originals from which
Caxton printed his well known moralised work, under the title of the
<EM>Game and Play of the Chesse</EM>. This fine copy is printed UPON
VELLUM, in a large gothic letter, in double columns. The type has rather
an uneven appearance, from the thickness of the vellum. There are several
large prints, which, in this copy, are illuminated.</P>

<P>L'ARBRE DES BATAILLES. <EM>Printed by Verard</EM>. 1493. Folio. Another
fine volume, printed UPON VELLUM. With the exception only of one or two
crumpled or soiled leaves, this copy is as perfect as can be desired. Look
from <EM>d iiij</EM>. to <EM>ej</EM>, for a set of exquisitely printed
leaves upon vellum, which cannot be surpassed. The cuts are here coloured
in the usually bold and brilliant style.</P>

<P>LA CHASSE ET LE DEPART D'AMOURS. <EM>Printed by Verard</EM>. 1509.
Folio. This volume of interesting old French poetry, UPON VELLUM, which is
printed in double columns, formerly belonged to the abbey of St. Germain
des Près--as an inscription upon the title denotes. The work abounds with
very curious, and very delectable old French poetry. Look, amongst a
hundred other similar things, at the <STRONG>"Balade ioyeuse des
taverniers</STRONG>," on the reverse <STRONG>Q</STRONG>. i: each stanza
ending with</P>

<P CLASS="poetry"><EM>Les tauerniers qui brouillent nostre vin.</EM></P>

<P>LA NEF DES FOLZ DU MONDE. <EM>Printed by Verard. Without Date</EM>.
Folio. A most magnificent copy; printed UPON VELLUM. Every page is highly
illuminated, with ample margins. What is a little extraordinary, the
reverse of the sixth leaf has ms. text above and below the large
illumination; while the recto of the same leaf has printed text. The
present noble volume, which has the royal arms stamped on the exterior, is
one of the few old books which has not suffered amputation by recent
binding.</P>

<P>THE SAME WORK. <EM>Printed by the Same</EM>. Folio. The poetry is in
double columns, and the cuts are coloured. I apprehend this copy to be
much cropt. It is UPON VELLUM: rather tawny, but upon the whole
exceedingly sound and desirable.</P>

<P>L'ART DE BIEN MOURIR. <EM>Printed for Verard</EM>. <EM>Without
Date</EM>. Folio. A fragment only of the Work. In large gothic type;
double columns: cuts coloured. There are two cuts of demons torturing
people in a cauldron, such as may be seen in the second volume of my
Typographical Antiquities.<A name="fnref_74"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_74">74</A> Some of these cuts, in turn, may be taken from the older
ones in block books. The present copy is UPON VELLUM, rather tawny: but it
is large and sound. In calf binding.</P>

<P>PARABOLES [de] MAISTRE ALAIN [De Lille] <EM>Printed by Verard</EM>,
1492. Folio. A magnificent volume, for size and condition. It is printed
in Verard's large type, in long lines. The illuminations are highly
coloured. This copy is UPON VELLUM.<A name="fnref_75"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_75">75</A></P>

<P>Suppose, now, I throw in a little variety from the preceding, by the
mention of a rare <EM>Italian</EM> book or two? Let me place before you a
choice copy of the</P>

<P>MONTE SANCTO DI DIO. <EM>Printed in 1477</EM>. Folio. This, you know,
is the volume about which the collectors of early copper-plate engraving
are never thoroughly happy until they possess a perfect copy of it:
perhaps a copy of a more covetable description than that which is now
before me. There is a duplicate of the first cut: of which one impression
is faint, and miserably coloured, and the other is so much cut away to the
left, as to deprive the man, looking up, of his left arm. There is an
exceedingly well executed duplicate of the large Christ, drawn with a pen.
In the genuine print there is too much of the burr. The impression of the
Devil eating human beings, within the lake of fire, is a good bold one.
This copy is bound in red morocco, but in a flaunting style of
ornament.</P>

<P>LA SFORZIADA. <EM>Printed in 1480</EM>. Folio. It is just possible you
may not have forgotten the description of a copy of this work--like the
present, struck off UPON VELLUM--which appears in the <EM>Bibliographical
Decameron</EM>.<A name="fnref_76"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_76">76</A> That copy, you may remember, adorns the choice collection
of our friend George Hibbert, Esq.<A name="fnref_77"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_77">77</A> The book before me is doubtless a most exquisite one;
and the copy is of large dimensions. The illuminated first page very
strongly resembles that in the copy just mentioned. The portraits appear
to be the same: but the Cardinal is differently habited, and his
phisiognomical expression is less characteristic here than in the same
portrait in Mr. Hibbert's copy. The head of Duke Sforza, his brother,
seems to be about the same.</P>

<P>The lower compartment of this splendidly illuminated page differs
materially from that of Mr. Hibbert's copy. There are two figures
kneeling, apparently portraits; with the sea in the distance. The figure
of St. Louis appears in the horizon--very curious. To the right, there are
rabbits within an enclosure, and human beings growing into trees. The
touch and style of the whole are precisely similar to what we observe in
the other copy so frequently mentioned. The capital initials are also very
similar. It is a pity that, during the binding, (which is in red morocco)
the vellum has been so very much crumpled. This copy measures thirteen
inches and seven eighths, by nine inches and three eighths.</P>

<P>I must now lay before you a few more Classics, and conclude the whole
with miscellaneous articles.</P>

<P>TERENTIUS. <EM>Printed by Ulric Han</EM>. Folio. <EM>Without date</EM>.
In all probability the first edition of the author by Ulric Han, and
perhaps the second in chronological order; that of Mentelin being
considered the first. It is printed in Ulric Han's larger roman type. This
may be considered a fine genuine copy--in old French binding, with the
royal arms.</P>

<P>ARISTOTELIS OPERA. <EM>Printed by Aldus</EM>. 1495, &amp;c. 6 vols.
Would you believe it--here are absolutely TWO copies of this glorious
effort of the Aldine Press, printed UPON VELLUM!? One copy belonged to the
famous <EM>Henri II. and Diane de Poictiers</EM>, and is about an eighth
of an inch taller and wider than the other; but the other has not met with
fair play, from the unskilful manner in which it has been bound--in red
morocco. Perhaps the interior of this second copy may be preferred to that
of Henri II. The illuminations are ancient, and elegantly executed, and
the vellum seems equally white and beautiful. Probably the tone of the
vellum in the other copy may be a <EM>little</EM> more sombre, but there
reigns throughout it such a sober, uniform, mellow and genuine air--that,
brilliant and captivating as may be the red morocco copy--<EM>he</EM>
ought to think more than <EM>once</EM> or <EM>twice</EM> who should give
it the preference. The arms of the morocco copy, in the first page of the
Life of Aristotle, from Diogenes Laertius, have been cut out. This copy
came from the monastery of St. Salvador; and the original, roughly
stamped, edges of the leaves are judiciously preserved in the binding.
Both copies have the <EM>first</EM> volume upon <EM>paper</EM>. Indeed it
seems now clearly ascertained that it was never printed upon vellum.<A
name="fnref_78"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_78">78</A> The copy of
Henri II. measures twelve inches and a quarter, by eight and an
eighth.</P>

<P>PLUTARCHI OPUSCULA MORALIA. <EM>Printed by Aldus</EM>. 1509. Folio. 2
vols. Another, delicious MEMBRANACEOUS treasure from the fine library of
Henri II. and Diane de Poictiers; in the good old original coverture,
besprinkled with interlaced D's and H's. It is in truth a lovely
book--measuring ten inches and five eighths, by seven inches and three
eighths; but I suspect a little cropt. Some of the vellum is also rather
tawny--especially the first and second leaves, and the first page of the
text of Plutarch. These volumes reminded me of the first Aldine Plato,
also UPON VELLUM, in the library of Dr. W. Hunter; but I question if the
Plato be <EM>quite</EM> so beautiful a production.</P>

<P>EUSTATHIUS IN HOMERUM. 1542. Folio. 4 vols. Printed UPON VELLUM--and
probably unique. A set of matchless volumes--yet has the binder done them
great injustice, by the manner in which the backs are cramped or choked.
The exteriors, in blazing red morocco, are not in the very best taste. A
good deal of the vellum is also of too yellow a tint, but it is of a most
delicate quality.</P>

<P>ARISTOTELIS ETHICA NICHOMACHEA. Gr. This volume forms a part only of
the first Aldine edition of the Nichomachean ethics of Aristotle. The
margins are plentifully charged with the Scholia of Basil the Great, as we
learn from an original letter of "Constantinus Palæocappa, grecus" to
Henry the Second--whose book it was, and who shewed the high sense he
entertained of the Scholia, by having the volume bound in a style of
luxury and splendour beyond any thing which I remember to have seen--as
coming from his library. The reverse of the first leaf exhibits a
beautiful frame work, of silver ornaments upon a black ground--now faded;
with the initials and devices of Henry and Diane de Poictiers. Their arms
and supporters are at top. Within this frame work is the original and
beautifully written letter of Constantine Palæocappa. On the opposite page
the text begins--surrounded by the same brilliant kind of ornament; having
an initial H of extraordinary beauty. The words, designating the Scholia,
are thus:</P>

<!-- [Greek: META SCHOLIÔN BASILEIOU TOU MEGALOU.]  -->
<P class="quote">&#924;&#917;&#932;&#913;
&#931;&#935;&#927;&#923;&#921;&#937;&#925;
&#914;&#913;&#931;&#921;&#923;&#917;&#921;&#927;&#933; &#932;&#927;&#933;
&#924;&#917;&#915;&#913;&#923;&#927;&#933;</P>

<P>These Scholia are written in a small, close, and yet free Greek
character, with frequent contractions. Several other pages exhibit the
peculiar devices of Henry and Diana--having silver crescents and arrow-
stocked quivers. This book is bound in boards, and covered with dark green
velvet, now almost torn to threads. In its original condition, it must
have been an equally precious and resplendent tome. It measures twelve
inches and a quarter, by eight inches and three eighths.</P>

<P>EUCLIDES. <EM>Printed by Ratdolt</EM>. 1482. Folio. A copy UPON VELLUM.
The address of Ratdolt, as it sometimes occurs, is printed in golden
letters; but I was disappointed in the view of this book. Unluckily the
first leaf of the text is ms. but of the time. At the bottom, in an
ancient hand, we read "<EM>Monasterii S. Saluatoris bonon. signatus In
Inuentario numero 524.</EM>" It is a large copy, but the vellum is rather
tawny.</P>

<P>PRISCIANUS. <EM>Printed by V. de Spira</EM>. 1470. Folio. First
edition, UPON VELLUM. This is a book, of which, as you may remember, some
mention has been previously made;<A name="fnref_79"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_79">79</A> and I own I was glad to turn over the membranaceous
leaves of a volume which had given rise, at the period of its acquisition,
to a good deal of festive mirth. At the first glance of it, I recognised
the cropping system. The very first page of the text has lost, if I may so
speak, its head and shoulders: nor is such amputation to be wondered at,
when we read, to the left, "<EM>Relié par</EM> DEROME dit le Jeune." Would
you believe it--nearly one half of the illumination, at top, has been
sliced away? The vellum is beautifully delicate, but unluckily not
uniformly white. Slight, but melancholy, indications of the worm are
visible at the beginning--which do not, however, penetrate a great way.
Yet, towards the end, the ravages of this book-devourer are renewed: and
the six last leaves exhibit most terrific evidences of his power. This
volume is bound in gay green morocco--with water-tabby pink lining.</P>

<P>BUDÆUS. COMMENT. GR. LING. 1529. Folio. Francis the First's own copy--
and UPON VELLUM! You may remember that this book was slightly alluded to
at the commencement of a preceding letter. It is indeed a perfect gem, and
does one's heart good to look at it. Budæus was the tutor of Francis, and
I warrant that he selected the very leaves, of which this copy is
composed, for his gallant pupil. Old Ascensius was the printer: which
completes the illustrious trio. The illuminations, upon the rectos of the
first and second leaves, are as beautiful as they are sound. Upon the
whole, this book may fairly rank with any volume in either of the vellum
sets of the Aldine Aristotle. It is bound in red morocco; a little too
gaudily.</P>

<P>CICERONIS ORATIONES. <EM>Printed by Valdarfer</EM>. 1471: Folio. Still
revelling among VELLUM copies of the early classics. This is a fine book,
but it is unluckily imperfect. I should say that it was of large and
genuine dimensions, did not a little close cropping upon the first
illuminated page tell a different tale. It measures twelve inches and six
eighths, by eight inches and a half. Upon the whole, though there be a few
uncomfortably looking perforations of the worm, this is a very charming
copy. Its imperfections do not consist of more than the deficiency of one
leaf, which contains the table.</P>

<P>OVIDII OPERA OMNIA. <EM>Printed by Azoguidi</EM>. 1471. Folio. 3 vols.
The supposed FIRST EDITION, and perhaps (when complete)<A name=
"fnref_80"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_80">80</A> the rarest Editio
Princeps in existence. The copy before me partakes of the imperfection of
almost every thing earthly. It wants two leaves: but it is a magnificent,
and I should think unrivalled, copy--bating such imperfection. It measures
very nearly thirteen inches and a quarter, by little more than eight
inches three quarters. It is bound in red morocco.</P>

<P>ÆSOPUS. Latinè. <EM>Printed by Dom. de Vivaldis, &amp;c</EM>. 1481.
Folio. A most singular volume--in hexameter and pentameter, verses. To
every fable is a wood cut, quite in the ballad style of execution, with a
back-ground like coarse mosaic work. The text is printed in a large clumsy
gothic letter. The present is a sound copy, but not free from stain. Bound
in blue morocco.</P>

<P>ÆSOPUS. Italicè. <EM>Edited by Tuppi</EM>. 1485. Folio. A well known
and highly coveted edition: but copies are very rare, especially when of
goodly dimensions. This is a large and beautiful book; although I observe
that the border, on the right margin of the first leaf, is somewhat cut
away. The graphic art in this volume has a very imposing appearance.</P>

<P>---- Germanicè. <EM>Without Date or Name of Printer</EM>. Folio. This
edition is printed in a fine large open gothic type. There is the usual
whole length cut of Æsop. The other cuts are spirited, after the fashion
of those in Boccacio De Malis Mulier. Illust.--printed by John Zeiner at
Ulm in 1473. The present is a fine, sound copy: in red morocco
binding.</P>

<P>ÆSOPUS. Germanicè. <EM>Without Date, &amp;c</EM>. Folio. This
impression, which, like the preceding, is destitute of signatures and
catchwords, is printed in a smaller gothic type. The wood cuts are
spirited, with more of shadow. Some of the initial letters are pretty and
curious. Some of the pages (see the last but fifteen) contain as many as
forty-five lines. The present is a fine, large copy.</P>

<P>---- Hispanicè. <EM>Printed at Burgos.</EM> 1496. Folio. This is a
beautiful and interesting volume, full of wood cuts. The title is within a
broad bold border, thus: "<STRONG>Libro del asopo famoso fabulador
historiado en romãce</STRONG>." On the reverse is the usual large wood cut
of Æsop, but his mouth is terribly diminished in size. The leaves are
numbered in large roman numerals. A fine clean copy, in blue morocco
binding.</P>

<P>And now, my dear friend, let us both breathe a little, by way of
cessation from labour: yourself from reading, and your correspondent from
the exercise of his pen. I own that I am fairly tired ... but in a few
days I shall resume the BOOK THEME with as much ardour as heretofore.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER VI.</H3>

<P>CONCLUSION OF THE ACCOUNT OF THE ROYAL LIBRARY. THE LIBRARY OF THE
ARSENAL.</P>

<P>My last letter left me on the first floor of the Royal Library. I am
now about to descend, and to take you with me to the ground floor--where,
as you may remember I formerly remarked, are deposited the <EM>Aldine
Vellums</EM> and <EM>Large Papers</EM>, and choice and curious copies from
the libraries of <EM>Grolier, Diane de Poictiers</EM>, and <EM>de
Thou</EM>. The banquet is equally delicious of its kind, although the
dishes are of a date somewhat more remote from the time of Apicius.</P>

<P>Corresponding with the almost interminable suite of book-rooms above,
is a similar suite below stairs: but the general appearance of the latter
is comparatively cold, desolate, and sombre. The light comes in, to the
right, less abundantly; and, in the first two rooms, the garniture of the
volumes is less brilliant and attractive. In short, these first two lower
rooms may be considered rather as the depot for the cataloguing and
forwarding of all modern books recently purchased. Let me now conduct you
to the <EM>third room</EM> in this lower suite, which may probably have a
more decided claim upon your attention. Here are deposited, as I just
observed, the VELLUM ALDUSES and other curious and choice old printed
volumes. I will first mention nearly the whole of the former.</P>

<P>HOMERI OPERA. Gr. <EM>Printed by Aldus. Without Date</EM>. 8vo. 2 vols.
A white and beautiful copy--with large, and genuine margins--printed UPON
VELLUM. In its original binding, with the ornaments tolerably entire:--and
what binding should this be, but that of Henry the Second and Diane de
Poictiers? Let me just notice that this copy measures six inches and a
half, by three inches and six eighths.</P>

<P>EURIPIDIS OPERA. Gr. 1503. 8vo. 2 vols. A fair and desirable copy UPON
VELLUM; but a little objectionable, as being ruled with red lines rather
unskilfully. It is somewhat coarsely bound in red morocco, and preserved
in a case. This vellum treasure is among the desiderata of Earl Spencer's
library; and I sincerely wish his Lordship no worse luck than the
possession of a copy like that before me.<A name="fnref_81"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_81">81</A></P>

<P>HECUBA, ET IPHIGENIA IN AULIDE. Gr. and Lat. 1507. 8vo. A very rare
book, and quite perfect, as far as it goes. This copy, also UPON VELLUM,
is much taller than the preceding of the entire works of Euripides; but
the vellum is not of so white a tint.</P>

<P>ANTHOLOGIA GRÆCA. Gr. 1503. 8vo. A very fine genuine copy, upon
excellent VELLUM. I suspect this copy to be a little broader, but by no
means taller, than a similar copy in Lord Spencer's collection.</P>

<P>HORATIUS. 1501. 8vo. UPON VELLUM: a good, sound copy; although inferior
to Lord Spencer's.</P>

<P>MARTIALIS. 1502. 8vo. Would you believe it?--here are <EM>two</EM>
copies UPON VELLUM, and <EM>both</EM> originally belonged to Grolier. They
are differently illuminated, but the tallest--measuring six inches three
eighths, by three inches six eighths--is the whitest, and the preferable
copy, notwithstanding one may discern the effects of the nibbling of a
worm at the bottom corner. It is, however, a beautiful book, in every
respect. The initial letters are gold. In the other copy there are the
arms of Grolier, with a pretty illumination in the first page of the text.
It is also a sound copy.</P>

<P>LUCRETIUS. 1515. 8vo. This copy, UPON VELLUM, is considered to be
unique. It is fair, sound, and in all respects desirable.</P>

<P>CICERO DE OFFICIIS. <EM>Without Date</EM>. 8vo. This is but a moderate
specimen of the Aldine VELLUM, if it be not a counterfeit--which I
suspect.<A name="fnref_82"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_82">82</A></P>

<P>CICERONIS ORATIONES. 1519. 8vo. UPON VELLUM. Only the first volume,
which however is quite perfect and desirable--measuring six inches and a
quarter, by very nearly four inches. But prepare for an account of a
perfect, and still more magnificent, vellum copy of the Orations of
Cicero--when I introduce you to the <EM>Library of St. Geneviève</EM>.</P>

<P>HIST. AUGUST. SCRIPTORES. 1521. 8vo. 2 vols. A sound and fair copy--of
course UPON VELLUM--but too much cropt in the binding. The foregoing are
all the <EM>Aldine, Greek and Latin Classics</EM>, printed UPON VELLUM,
which the liberal kindness of M. Van Praet enabled me to lay my hands
upon. But here follows another membranaceous gem of the Aldine Family.</P>

<P>PETRARCHA. 1501. 8vo. A beautiful, white copy, measuring six inches and
a half, by three and three quarters. It is, however, somewhat choked in
the binding, (in blue morocco) as too many of Bozerian's performances
usually are.<A name="fnref_83"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_83">83</A>
Close to this book is the Giunta reprint of 1515--ALSO UPON VELLUM: but of
a foxy and unpleasing tint. Now for a few LARGE PAPER ALDUSES--of a
variety of forms and of characters. But I must premise that the ensuing
list of those upon vellum, is very far indeed from being complete.</P>

<P>HORÆ. Gr. 1497. 12mo. A beautiful copy, among the very rarest of books
which have issued from the Aldine press. Here is also <EM>one</EM> volume
of the Aldine ARISTOTLE, upon <EM>large paper</EM>: and only one. Did the
<EM>remaining</EM> volumes ever so exist? I should presume they did.</P>

<P>BIBLIA GRÆCA. 1518. Folio. Upon <EM>thick paper</EM>. Francis the
First's own copy. A glorious and perhaps matchless copy. Yet it is
rebacked, in modern binding, in a manner ... almost shameful!</P>

<P>PLAUTUS. 1522. Small quarto. A very fine copy; in all appearance large
paper, and formerly belonging to Grolier.</P>

<P>AUSONIUS. 1517. 8vo. Large paper; very fine; and belonging to the
same.</P>

<P>VALERIUS MAXIMUS. 1534. 8vo. The same--in <EM>all</EM> respects.</P>

<P>PRISCIANUS. 1527. 8vo. Every characteristic before mentioned.</P>

<P>SANNAZARII ARCADIA. <EM>Ital</EM>. 1514. 8vo. The same.</P>

<P>---- <EM>De Partu Virginis</EM>. 1533. 8vo. An oblong, large paper
Grolier, like most of the preceding.</P>

<P>ISOCRATES. Gr. 1534. Folio. EUSTRATIUS IN ARISTOT. Gr. 1536. Both upon
<EM>large paper</EM>, of the largest possible dimensions, and in the
finest possible condition; add to which--rich and rare old binding! Both
these books, upon large paper, are wanting in Lord Spencer's collection;
but then, as a pretty stiff set-off, his Lordship has the THEMISTIUS of
1534--which, for size and condition, may challenge either of the
preceding--and which is here wanting.</P>

<P>GALENUS. 1525. Gr. Folio. 5 vols. A matchless set, upon <EM>large
paper</EM>. The binding claims as much attention, before you open the
volumes, as does a finely-proportioned Greek portico--ere you enter the
temple or the mansion. The foregoing are all, doubtless, equally splendid
and uncommon specimens of the beauty and magnificence of the press of the
<EM>Alduses</EM>: and they are also, with very few exceptions, as
intrinsically valuable as they are fine. I shall conclude my survey of
these lower-book-regions by noticing a few more uncommon books of their
kind.</P>

<P>CATHARIN DE SIENA. 1500. Folio. This volume is also a peculiarity in
the Aldine department. It is, in the first place, a very fine copy--and
formerly belonged to Anne of Brittany. In the second place, it has a
wood-cut prefixed, and several introductory pieces, which, if I remember
rightly, do not belong to Lord Spencer's copy of the same edition.</P>

<P>ISOCRATES. Gr. <EM>Printed at Milan</EM>. 1493. Folio. What is somewhat
singular, there is another copy of this book which has a title and imprint
of the date of 1535 or 1524; in which the old Greek character of the body
of the work is rather successfully imitated.<A name="fnref_84"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_84">84</A></P>

<P>BIBLIA POLYGLOTTA COMPLUTENSIA. 1516-22. Fol. 6 vols. I doubt
exceedingly whether this be not the largest and finest copy in existence.
It may possibly be even <EM>large paper</EM>--but certainly, if otherwise,
it is among the most ample and beautiful. The colour, throughout, is white
and uniform; which is not the usual characteristic of copies of this work.
It measures fourteen inches and three quarters in height, and belonged
originally to Henry II. and Diane de Poictiers. It wanted only
<EM>this</EM> to render it unrivalled; and it now undoubtedly <EM>is</EM>
so.</P>

<P>TESTAMENTUM NOVUM. Gr. <EM>Printed by R. Stephen</EM>. 1550. Folio.
Another treasure from the same richly-fraught collection. It is quite a
perfect copy; but some of the silver ornaments of the sides have been
taken off. Let me now place before you a few more testimonies of the
splendour of that library, which was originally the chief ornament of the
<EM>Chateau d'Anet</EM>,<A name="fnref_85"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_85">85</A> and not of the Louvre.</P>

<P>HERODOTUS. Gr. <EM>Printed by Aldus</EM>, 1502. Folio. I had long
supposed Lord Spencer's copy--like this, upon LARGE PAPER--to be the
finest first Aldine Herodotus in existence: but the first glimpse only of
the present served to dissipate that belief. What must repeated glimpses
have produced?</P>

<P>LUCIANUS. Gr. <EM>Printed by the Same</EM>. 1503. Folio. Equally
beautiful--large, white, and crackling--with the preceding.</P>

<P>SUIDAS. Gr. <EM>Printed by the Same</EM>. 1503. Folio. The same praise
belongs to this copy; which, like its precursors, is clothed in the first
mellow and picturesque binding.</P>

<P>EUSTATHIUS IN HOMERUM. 1542. Folio. 3 vols. A noble copy--eclipsed
perhaps, in amplitude only, by that in the collection of Mr.
Grenville.</P>

<P>DION CASSIUS. Gr. 1548. Folio. APPIANUS. Gr. 1551. Folio. DIONYSIUS
HALICARNASSENSIS. 1546. Folio. These exquisitely well printed volumes are
from the press of the Stephens. The present copies, clothed in their
peculiar bindings, are perhaps the most beautiful that exist. They are
from the library of the Chateau d'Anet. Let it not be henceforth said that
the taste of Henri II. was not <EM>well</EM> directed by the influence of
Diane de Poictiers, in the choice of BOOKS.</P>

<P>CICERONIS OPERA OMNIA. <EM>Printed by the Giunti</EM>, 1534. Folio. 4
vols. I introduce this copy to your notice, because there are four leaves
of <EM>Various Readings</EM>, at the end of the fourth volume, which M.
Van Praet said he had never observed, nor heard of, in any other copy.<A
name="fnref_86"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_86">86</A> I think also
that there are two volumes of the same edition upon LARGE PAPER:--the rest
being deficient. Does any perfect copy, of this kind, exist?</P>

<P>POETÆ GRÆCI HEROICI. 1556. <EM>Printed by H. Stephen.</EM> Folio. De
Thou's own copy--and, upon the whole, perhaps MATCHLESS. The sight of this
splendid volume would repay the toil of a pilgrimage of some fourscore
miles, over Lapland snows. There is another fine copy of the same edition,
which belonged to Diana and her royal slave; but it is much inferior to De
Thou's.</P>

<P>The frequent mention of DE THOU reminds me of the extraordinary number
of copies, which came from his library, and which are placed upon the
shelves of the <EM>fourth</EM> or following room. Perhaps no other library
can boast of such a numerous collection of similar copies. It was, while
gazing upon these interesting volumes along with M. Van Praet, that the
latter told me he remembered seeing the ENTIRE LIBRARY of De Thou--before
it was dispersed by the sale of the collection of the Prince de Soubise in
1788--in which it had been wholly embodied, partly by descent, and partly
by purchase. And now farewell ... to the BIBLIOTHÈQUE DU ROI. We have, I
think, tarried in it a good long time; and recreated ourselves with a
profusion of RICH AND RARE GEMS in the book-way--whether as specimens of
the pencil, or of the press. I can never regret the time so devoted--nor
shall ever banish from my recollection the attention, civility, and
kindness which I have received, from all quarters, in this magnificent
library. It remains only to shake hands with the whole <EM>Corps
Bibliographique</EM>, who preside over these regions of knowledge, and
whose names have been so frequently mentioned--and, making our bow, to
walk arm in arm together to the</P>

<P>LIBRARY OF THE ARSENAL.</P>

<P>The way thither is very interesting, although not very short. Whether
your hackney coachman take you through the <EM>Marché des Innocents</EM>,
or straight forward, along the banks of the Seine--passing two or three
bridges--you will be almost equally amused. But reflections of a graver
cast will arise, when you call to mind that it was in his way to THIS VERY
LIBRARY--to have a little bibliographical, or rather perhaps political,
chat with his beloved Sully--that Henry IV. fell by the hand of an
Assassin.<A name="fnref_87"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_87">87</A> They
shew you, at the further end of the apartments--distinguished by its
ornaments of gilt, and elaborate carvings--the <EM>very boudoir</EM> ...
where that monarch and his prime minister frequently retired to settle the
affairs of the nation. Certainly, no man of education or of taste can
enter such an apartment without a diversion of some kind being given to
the current of his feelings. I will frankly own that I lost, for one
little minute, the recollection of the hundreds and thousands of
volumes--including even those which adorn the chamber wherein the head
librarian sits--which I had surveyed in my route thither. However, my
present object must be exclusively confined to an account of a very few
choice articles of these hundreds and thousands of volumes.</P>

<P>BIBLIA LATINA. <EM>Printed by Fust and Schoiffher</EM>, 1462. 2 vols.
There are not fewer than <EM>three</EM> copies of this edition, which I
shall almost begin to think must be ranked among books of ordinary
occurrence. Of these three, two are UPON VELLUM, and the third is upon
paper. The latter, or paper copy, is cruelly cropt, and bad in every
respect. Of the two upon vellum, one is in vellum binding, and a fair
sound copy; except that it has a few initials cut out. The other vellum
copy, which is bound in red morocco--measuring full fifteen inches and a
half, by eleven inches and a quarter--affords the comfortable evidence of
ancient ms. signatures at bottom. There are doubtless some exceptionable
leaves; but, upon the whole, it is a very sound and desirable copy. It was
obtained of the elder M. Brunet, father of the well-known author of the
Manuel du Libraire. M. Brunet senior found it in the garret of a
monastery, of which he had purchased the entire library; and he sold it to
the father of the present Comte d'Artois for six hundred livres ...
only!</P>

<P>ROMAUNT DE JASON, <EM>Supposed to be printed by Caxton</EM>. Folio.
<EM>Without date</EM>. This is a finer copy than the one in the Royal
Library; but it is imperfect, wanting two leaves.</P>

<P>Here is a copy of the very rare edition of the MORLINI <EM>Novella
Comoediæ et Fabulæ</EM>, printed in 1520 in 4to.:--also of the <EM>Teatro
Jesuitico--impresso en Coimbra</EM>, 1634, 4to.:--and of the <EM>Missa
Latina</EM>, printed by Mylius in 1557, 8vo. which latter is a satire upon
the mass, and considered exceedingly rare. I regretted to observe so very
bad a copy of the original <EM>Giunta</EM> Edition of the BOCCACCIO of
1527, 4to.</P>

<P>MISSALE PARISIENSE. 1522. Folio. A copy UPON VELLUM. I do not think it
possible for any library, in any part of the world, to produce a more
lovely volume than that upon which, at this moment, I must be supposed to
be gazing! In the illuminated initial letters, wood-cuts, tone and quality
of the vellum, and extreme skilfulness of the printer--it surely cannot be
surpassed. Nor is the taste of the binding inferior to its interior
condition. It is habited in the richly-starred morocco livery of Claude
d'Urfé: in other words, it came from that distinguished man's library.
Originally it appears to have been in the "<EM>Bibliothèque de l'Eglise à
Paris</EM>."</P>

<P><EM>Mozarabic Missal and Breviary</EM>. 1500, 1502. Folio. Original
Editions. These copies are rather cropt, but sound and perfect.</P>

<P>THE DELPHIN STATIUS. Two copies: of which that in calf is the whitest,
and less beaten: the other is in dark morocco. The Abbé Grosier told me
that De Bure had offered him forty louis for one of them: to which I
replied, and now repeat the question, "where is the use of keeping
<EM>two</EM>?" Rely upon it, that, within a dozen years from hence, it
will turn out that these Delphin Statiuses have never been even
<EM>singed</EM> by a fire!<A name="fnref_88"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_88">88</A> I begin to suspect that this story may be classed in the
number of BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DELUSIONS--upon which subject our friend * *
could publish a most interesting crown octavo volume: meet garniture for a
Bibliomaniac's breakfast table.</P>

<P>Here is the ALDINE BIBLE of 1518, in Greek, upon <EM>thick paper</EM>,
bound in red morocco. Also a very fine copy of the <EM>Icelandic
Bible</EM> of 1644, folio, bound in the same manner. Among the religious
formularies, I observed a copy of the <EM>Liturgia Svecanæ Ecclesiæ
catliolicæ et orthodoxæ conformis</EM>, in 1576, folio--which contains
only LXXVI leaves, besides the dedication and preface. It has a wood-cut
frontispiece, and the text is printed in a very large gothic letter. The
commentary is in a smaller type. This may be classed among the rarer books
of its kind. But I must not forget a MS. of <EM>The Hours of St.
Louis</EM>--considered as <EM>contemporaneous</EM>. It is a most beautiful
small folio, or rather imperial octavo; and is in every respect brilliant
and precious. The gold, raised greatly beyond what is usually seen in MSS.
of this period, is as entire as it is splendid. The miniature paintings
are all in a charming state of preservation, and few things of this kind
can be considered more interesting.</P>

<P>This library has been long celebrated for its collection of <EM>French
Topography</EM> and of early <EM>French</EM> and <EM>Spanish
Romances</EM>; a great portion of the latter having been obtained at the
sale of the Nyon Library. I shall be forgiven, I trust, if I neglect the
former for the latter. Prepare therefore for a list of some choice
articles of this description--in every respect worthy of conspicuous
places in all future <EM>Roxburghe</EM> and <EM>Stanley</EM> collections.
The books now about to be described are, I think, almost all in that
apartment which leads immediately into Sully's boudoir. They are described
just as I took them from the shelves.</P>

<P>RICHARD-SANS PEUR, &amp;c. "<EM>A Paris Par Nicolas et Pierre
Bonfons</EM>," &amp;c. <EM>Without Date</EM>. 4to. It is executed in a
small roman type, in double columns. There is an imposing wood-cut of
Richard upon horseback, in the frontispiece, and a very clumsy one of the
same character on the reverse. The signatures run to E in fours. An
excellent copy.</P>

<P>LE MEME ROMANT. "<EM>Imprime nouuelement a Paris</EM>." At the end,
printed by "<EM>Alain Lotrain et Denis Janot</EM>." 4to. <EM>Without
Date</EM>. The title, just given is printed in a large gothic letter, in
red and black lines, alternately, over a rude-wood cut of Richard upon
horseback. The signatures A, B, C, run in fours: D in eight, and E four.
The text is executed in a small coarse gothic letter, in long lines. The
present is a sound good copy.</P>

<P>ROBERT LE DYABLE. "La terrible Et merueilleuse vie de Robert Le Dyable
iiii C." 4to. <EM>Without Date</EM>. The preceding is over a large
wood-cut of Robert, with a club in his hand, forming the frontispiece. The
signatures run to D, in fours; with the exception of A, which has eight
leaves. The work is printed in double columns, in a small gothic type. A
sound desirable copy.</P>

<P>SYPPERTS DE VINEUAULX. "Lhystoire plaisante et recreative faisant
metion des prouesses et vaillãces du noble Sypperts de Vineuaulx Et de ses
dix septs filz Nouuellement imprime." At the end: printed for "<EM>Claude
veufue de feu Iehan sainct denys</EM>," 4to. <EM>Without Date</EM>. On the
reverse of this leaf there is a huge figure of a man straddling, holding a
spear and shield, and looking over his left shoulder. I think I have seen
this figure before. This impression is executed in long lines, in a small
gothic letter. A sound copy of a very rare book.<A name="fnref_89"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_89">89</A></P>

<P>GUY DE VVARWICH. "Lhystoire de Guy de vvarwich Cheualier dãgleterre
&amp;c. 4to. <EM>No Date</EM>. The preceding is over a wood-cut of the
famous Guy and his fair Felixe. At bottom, we learn that it is executed in
a small gothic type, in double columns. The colophon is on the reverse of
V. six</P>

<P>MESSER NOBILE SOCIO. "Le Miserie de li Amanti di Messer Mobile Socio."
Colophon: "<EM>Stampata in Vinegia per Maestro Bernardino de Vitali
Veneciano</EM> MDXXXIII." 4to. This impression is executed in long lines,
in a fair, good, italic letter. The signatures, from <EM>a</EM> to
<EM>y</EM> inclusively, run in fours. The colophon, just given, is on the
reverse of <EM>z</EM> i. Of this romance I freely avow my total
ignorance.</P>

<P>CASTILLE ET ARTUS D'ALGARBE. 4to. This title is over what may be called
rather a spirited wood-cut. The date below is 1587. It is printed in
double columns, in a small roman type. In the whole, forty-eight leaves. A
desirable copy.</P>

<P>LA NEF DES DAMES. 4to, <EM>Without Date</EM>. This title is composed of
one line, in large lower-case gothic, in black, (just as we see in some of
the title pages of Gerard de Leeu) with the rest in four lines, in a
smaller gothic letter, printed in red. In this title page is also seen a
wood-cut of a ship, with the virgin and child beneath.</P>

<P>This book exhibits a fine specimen of rich gothic type, especially in
the larger fount--with which the poetry is printed. There is rather an
abundant sprinkling of wood cuts, with marginal annotations. The greater
part of the work is in prose, in a grave moral strain. The colophon is a
recapitulation of the title, ending thus: "<EM>Imprime a Lyon sur le rosne
par Iaques arnollet</EM>." This is a sound but somewhat soiled copy. In
torn parchment binding.</P>

<P>NOVELAS FOR MARIA DE ZAYAS, &amp;c. <EM>En Zaragoça, en el Hospital
Real</EM>, &amp;c. <EM>Ano 1637</EM>." 4to. These novels are ten in
number; some of them containing Spanish poetry. An apparently much
enlarged edition appeared in 1729. 4to. "<EM>Corregidas y enmendadas en
esta ultima impression</EM>."</P>

<P>NOVELAS AMOROSAS. <EM>Madrid</EM>, 1624." 4to. Twelve novels, in prose:
192 leaves. Subjoined in this copy, are the "Heroydas Belicas, y Amoras,
&amp;c. <EM>En Barcelona</EM>, &amp;c. 1622. 4to. The whole of these
latter are in three-line stanzas: 109 leaves.</P>

<P>SVCESSOS Y PRODIGOS DE AMOR. <EM>En Madrid</EM>. 1626. 4to. 166 leaves.
At the end: "Orfeo, en lengva Castellana. A la decima Mvsa." By the same
author: in four cantos: thirty-one leaves.</P>

<P>EL CAVALLERO CID. "El Cid rvy Diez de Viuar."</P>

<P>The preceding title is over a wood-cut of a man on horseback, trampling
upon four human bodies. At bottom: <EM>Impresso con licencia en Salamanca,
Ano de 1627</EM>." 4to.: 103 pages. At the end are, the "<EM>Seys Romances
del Cid Ruy Diaz de Biuar</EM>." The preceding is on A (i). Only four
leaves in the whole; quite perfect, and, as I should apprehend, of
considerable rarity. This slender tract appears to have been printed at
<EM>Valladolid por la viuda de Francisco de Cordoua, Ano de 1627</EM>."
4to.</P>

<P>FIORIO E BIANCIFIORE. "<EM>Impressa, &amp;. ne bologna, Delanno del
nostro signore m.cccclxxx. adi. xxiii. di decembre. Laus deo."</EM> Folio.
Doubtless this must be the <EM>Prima Edizione</EM> of this long popular
romance; and perhaps the present may be a unique copy of it. Caxton, as
you may remember, published an English prosaïc version of it in the year
1485; and no copy of <EM>that</EM> version is known, save the one in the
cabinet at St. James's Place. This edition has only eight leaves, and this
copy happens unluckily to be in a dreadfully shattered and tender state.
At the end:</P>

<P CLASS="quote"><EM>Finito e il libra del fidelissimo Amore
Che portorno insieme Fiorio e Biancifiore</EM></P>

<P>Subjoined to the copy just described is another work, thus
entitled:</P>

<P CLASS="poetry">SECRETO SOLO e in arma ben amaistrato<BR>
Sia qualunqua nole essere inamorato.<BR>
Got gebe ir eynen guten seligen mogen.</P>

<P>The preceding, line for line, is printed in a large gothic type: the
rest of the work in a small close gothic letter. Both pieces, together,
contain sixty-three leaves.</P>

<P>COMMEDIA DE CELESTINA. "<EM>Vendese la presente obra en la ciudad de
Anuers</EM>," &amp;c. 18mo. <EM>Without Date</EM>. I suspect however that
this scarce little volume was <EM>printed</EM> as well as "<EM>sold</EM>"
at Paris.</P>

<P>MILLES ET AMYS. "<EM>A Rouen chez la Veufue de Louys Costé</EM>." 4to.
Without Date. The frontispiece has a wood-cut of no very extraordinary
beauty, and the whole book exhibits a sort of ballad-style of printing. It
is executed in a roman letter, in double columns.</P>

<P>OGIER LE DANOIS. "<EM>On les vend a Lyon</EM>, &amp;c." Folio. At the
end is the date of 1525, over the printer's device of a lion couchant, and
a heart and crown upon a shield. It is a small folio, printed in a neat
and rather brilliant gothic type, with several wood-cuts.</P>

<P>GALIEN ET JAQUELINE. "<EM>Les nobles prouesses et vaillances de Galien
restaure</EM>," &amp;c. 1525, Folio. The preceding is over a large wood-
cut of a man on horseback; and this romance is printed by the same
printer, in the same place, and, as you observe, in the same year--as is
that just before described.</P>

<P>HUON DE BOURDEAUX. Here are four editions of this Romance:--to which I
suspect fourscore more might be added. The first is printed at
<EM>Paris</EM> for <EM>Bonfons</EM>, in double columns, black letter, with
rude wood-cuts. A fine copy: from the Colbert Collection. The second
edition is of the date of 1586: in long lines, roman letter, approaching
the ballad-style of printing. The third edition is "<EM>A Troyes, Chez
Nicolas Oudot</EM>, &amp;c. 1634." 4to. in double columns, small roman
letter. No cuts, but on the recto and reverse of the frontispiece. The
fourth edition is also "<EM>A Troyes Chez Pierre Garnier</EM>, 1726," 4to.
in double columns, roman letter. A very ballad-like production.</P>

<P>LES QUATRE FILZ AYMON, Two. editions. One. "<EM>à Lyon par Benoist
Rigaud</EM>, 1583," 4to. The printing is of the ballad-kind, although
there are some spirited wood-cuts, which have been wretchedly pulled. The
generality are as bad as the type and paper.</P>

<P>MABRIAN. &amp;c. "<EM>A Troyes, Chez Oudot</EM>, 1625," 4to. A vastly
clever wood-cut frontispiece, but wretched paper and printing. From the
<EM>Cat. de Nyon</EM>; no. 8135.</P>

<P>MORGANT LE GEANT. "<EM>A Troyes, Chez Nicholas Oudot</EM>, 1650, 4to."
A pretty wood-cut frontispiece, and an extraordinary large cut of St.
George and the Dragon on the reverse. There was a previous Edition by the
same Printer at Rouen, in 1618, which contains the second book--wanting in
this copy.</P>

<P>GERARD COMTE DE NEVERS, &amp;C. 1526, 4to. The title is over the arms
of France, and the text is executed in a handsome gothic letter, in long
lines. At the end, it appears to have been printed for <EM>Philip le
Noir</EM>. It is a very small quarto, and the volume is of excessive
rarity. The present is a fine copy, in red morocco binding.</P>

<P>CRONIQUE DE FLORIMONT, &amp;C. At "<EM>Lyons--par Olivier
Arnoullet</EM>," 4to. At the end is the date of 1529. This impression is
executed in a handsome gothic type, in long lines.</P>

<P>TROYS FILZ DE ROYS. Printed for "<EM>Nicolas Chrestien--en la Rue
neufue nostre Dame</EM>," &amp;c. Without date, 4to. The frontispiece
displays a large rude wood cut; and the edition is printed in the black
letter, in double columns. All the cuts are coarse. The book, however, is
of uncommon occurrence.</P>

<P>PARIS ET VIENNE:--"<EM>à Paris, Chez Simon Caluarin rue St.
Jacques</EM>." Without date: in double columns; black letter, coarsely
printed. A pretty wood-cut at the beginning is repeated at the end. This
copy is from the Colbert Library.</P>

<P>PIERRE DE PROVENCE ET LA BELLE MAGUELONNE. 1490. 4to. The title is over
a large wood-cut of a man and woman, repeated on the reverse of the leaf.
The impression is in black letter, printed in long lines, with rather
coarse wood-cuts. I apprehend this small quarto volume to be of extreme
rarity.</P>

<P>JEHAN DE SAINTRE--"<EM>Paris, pour Jehan Bonfons</EM>," &amp;c. 4to.
<EM>Without date</EM>. A neatly printed book, in double columns, in the
gothic character. There is no cut but in the frontispiece. A ms. note
says, "This is the first and rarest edition, and was once worth twelve
louis." The impression is probably full three centuries old.</P>

<P>BERINUS ET AYGRES DE LAYMANT. At bottom: sold at "<EM>Paris par Jehan
de Bonfons</EM>, 4to. <EM>No date.</EM> It is in double columns, black
letter, with the device of the printer on the reverse of the last leaf. A
rare book.</P>

<P>JEAN DE PARIS. "Le Romãt de Iehan de Paris, &amp;c. <EM>à Paris, par
Jehan Bonfons</EM>, 4to. <EM>Without date</EM>. In black letter, long
lines: with rather pretty wood-cuts. A ms. note at the end says: "Ce roman
que jay lu tout entier est fort singulier et amusant--cest de luy douvient
le proverbe "<EM>train de Jean de Paris</EM>." Cest ici la plus ancienne
edition. Elle est rare." The present is a sound copy. There are some
pleasing wood-cuts at the end.</P>

<P>CRONIQUE DE CLERIADUS, &amp;C. "<EM>On les vend à Lyon au pres de
nostre dame de confort cheulx Oliuier Arnoullet</EM>. At the end; 1529.
4to. This edition, which is very scarce, is executed in a handsome gothic
type, in long lines. The present is a cropt but sound copy.</P>

<P>GUILLAUME DE PALERNE, &amp;C. At bottom--beneath a singular wood-cut of
some wild animal (wolf or fox) running away with a child, and a group of
affrighted people retreating--we read: "<EM>On les vent a Lyon aupres Dame
de Confort chez Oliuier Arnoulle</EM>." At the end is the date of
1552.</P>

<P>---- Another edition of the same romance, <EM>printed at Rouen, without
date, by the widow of Louis Costé</EM>, 4to. A mere ballad-style of
publication: perhaps not later than 1634.--the date of our wretched and
yet most popular impression of the Knights of the Round Table.</P>

<P>DAIGREMONT ET VIVIAN. <EM>Printed by Arnoullet, at Lyons</EM>, in 1538,
4to. It is executed in a handsome gothic letter, in long lines. This copy
is bound up with the <EM>first</EM> edition of the Cronique de
Florimont--for which turn to a preceding page<A name="fnref_90"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_90">90</A>. In the same volume is a third romance,
entitled</P>

<P>LA BELLE HELAYNE, 1528, 4to.:--<EM>Printed by the same printer</EM>,
with a singular wood-cut frontispiece; in a gothic character not quite so
handsome as in the two preceding pieces.</P>

<P>JOURDAIN DE BLAVE. <EM>A Paris, par Nicolas Chrestien</EM>," 4to.
<EM>Without date</EM>. Printed in double columns, in a small coarse gothic
letter.</P>

<P>DOOLIN DE MAYENCE. <EM>A Paris--N. Bonfons</EM>. <EM>Without date</EM>,
4to. Probably towards the end of the sixteenth century; in double columns,
in the roman letter. Here is another edition, <EM>printed at Rouen</EM>,
by <EM>Pierre Mullot</EM>; in roman letter; in double columns. A coarse,
wretched performance.</P>

<P>MEURVIN FILS D'OGER, &amp;C. <EM>A Paris;--Nicolas Bonfons</EM>." 4to.
<EM>Without date</EM>. In the roman letter, in double columns. A fine
copy.</P>

<P>MELUSINE. Evidently by <EM>Philip le Noir</EM>, from his device at the
end. It is executed in a coarse small gothic letter; with a strange,
barbarous frontispiece. Another edition, having a copy of the same
frontispiece,--"<EM>Nouuellement Imprimee a Troyes par Nicolas Oudot.
1649."</EM> 4to. Numerous wood-cuts. In long lines, in the roman
letter.</P>

<P>TREBISOND. At the end: for "<EM>Iehan Trepperel demourãt en la rue
neufue nostre dame A lenseigne de lescu de frãc</EM>. Without date, 4to.
The device of the printer is at the back of the colophon. This impression
is executed in the black letter, in double columns, with divers
wood-cuts.</P>

<P>HECTOR DE TROYE. The title is over a bold wood-cut frontispiece, and
<EM>Arnoullet</EM> has the honour of being printer of the volume. It is
executed in the black letter, in long lines. After the colophon, at the
end, is a leaf containing a wood-cut of a man and woman, which I remember
to have seen more than once before.</P>

<P>And now, methinks, you have had a pretty liberal assortment of ROMANCES
placed before you, and may feel disposed to breathe the open air, and quit
for a while this retired but interesting collection of ancient tomes.
Here, then, let us make a general obeisance and withdraw; especially as
the official announce of "deux heures viennent de sonner" dissipates the
charm of chivalrous fiction, and warns us to shut up our volumes and
begone.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER VII.</H3>

<P>LIBRARY OF STE. GENEVIÈVE. THE ABBÉ MERCIER ST. LÉGER. LIBRARY OF THE
MAZARINE COLLEGE, OR INSTITUTE. PRIVATE LIBRARY OF THE KING. MONS.
BARBIER, LIBRARIAN.</P>

<P>It is just possible that you may not have forgotten, in a previous
letter, the mention of STE. GENEVIÈVE--situated in the old quarter of
Paris, on the other side of the Seine; and that, in opposition to the
<EM>ancient</EM> place or church, so called, there was the <EM>new</EM>
Ste. Geneviève--or the Pantheon. My present business is with the
<EM>old</EM> establishment: or rather with the LIBRARY, hard by the old
church of Ste. Geneviève. Of all interiors of libraries, this is probably
the most beautiful and striking; and it is an absolute reproach to the
taste of antiquarian art at Paris, that so beautiful an interior has not
been adequately represented by the burin. There is surely spirit and taste
enough in this magnificent capital to prevent such a reproach from being
of a much longer continuance. But my business is with the
<EM>original</EM>, and not with any <EM>copy</EM> of it--however
successful. M. Flocon is the principal librarian, but he is just now from
home<A name="fnref_91"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_91">91</A>. M. Le
Chevalier is the next in succession, and is rarely from his official
station. He is a portly gentleman; unaffected, good-natured, and
kind-hearted. He has lived much in England, and speaks our language
fluently: and catching my arm, and leaning upon it, he exclaimed, with a
sort of heart's chuckle--in English, "with all my soul I attend you to the
library."</P>

<P>On entering that singularly striking interior, he whispered gently in
my ear "you shall be consigned to a clever attendant, who will bring you
what you want, and I must then leave you to your occupations." "You cannot
confer upon me a greater favour," I replied. "Bon, (rejoined he) je vois
bien que vous aimez les livres. A ça, marchons." I was consigned to a
gentleman who sat at the beginning of the left rectangular
compartment--for the library is in the form of a cross--and making my bow
to my worthy conductor, requested he would retire to his own more
important concerns. He shook me by the hand, and added, in English--"Good
day, God bless you, Sir." I was not wanting in returning a similar
salutation.</P>

<P>The LIBRARY OF STE. GENEVIÈVE exhibits a local of a very imposing, as
well as extensive, appearance. From its extreme length,--which cannot be
less than two hundred and thirty feet, as I should conjecture--it looks
rather low. Yet the ceiling being arched, and tolerably well ornamented,
the whole has a very harmonious appearance. In the centre is a cupola: of
which the elder Restout, about ninety years ago, painted the ceiling. They
talk much of this painting, but I was not disposed to look at it a second
time. The charm of the whole arises, first, from the mellow tone of light
which is admitted from the glazed top of this cupola; and, secondly, from
the numerous busts, arranged along the sides, which recal to your
remembrance some of the most illustrious characters of France--for arts,
for arms, for learning, and for public spirit. These busts are at the
hither end, as you enter. Busts of foreigners continue the suite towards
the other extremities. A good deal of white carved ornament presents
itself, but not unpleasantly: the principal ground colour being of a
sombre tint, harmonising with that of the books. The floor is of glazed
tile. It was one of the hottest of days when I first put my foot within
this interior; and my very heart seemed to be refreshed by the
coolness--the tranquillity--the congeniality of character--of every thing
around me! In such a place, "hours" (as Cowper somewhere expresses it) may
be "thought down to moments." A sort of soft, gently-stealing, echo
accompanies every tread of the foot. You long to take your place among the
studious, who come every day to read in the right compartment of the
cross; and which compartment they as regularly <EM>fill</EM>. Meanwhile,
scarcely a whisper escapes them. The whole is, indeed, singularly inviting
to contemplation, research, and instruction. But it was to the left of the
cupola--and therefore opposite the studious corps just mentioned--that M.
Le Chevalier consigned me to my bibliographical attendant. I am ignorant
of his name, but cannot be forgetful of his kind offices. The MS.
Catalogue (they have no printed one) was placed before me, and I was
requested to cater for myself. Among the <EM>Libri Desiderati</EM> of the
fifteenth century, I smiled to observe the <EM>Naples Horace of</EM> 1474
... but you wish to be informed of the <EM>acquired</EM>, and not of the
<EM>desiderated</EM>, treasures. Prepare, therefore, for a treat--of its
kind.</P>

<P>LACTANTIUS. <EM>Printed in the Soubiaco Monastery</EM>. 1465. Folio.
This was Pope Pius the Sixth's copy. Indeed the greater number of the more
valuable early books belonged to that amiable Pontiff; upon whom
Audiffredi (as you may well remember) has passed so warm and so well
merited an eulogium<A name="fnref_92"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_92">92</A>. The papal copy, however, has its margins scribbled upon,
and is defective in the leaf which contains the errata.</P>

<P>AUGUSTINUS DE CIVITATE DEI. <EM>Printed in the same Monastery</EM>.
1467. Folio. The margins are broad, but occasionally much stained. The
copy is also short. From the same papal collection.</P>

<P>CICERO DE ORATORE. <EM>Printed in the same Monastery</EM>. <EM>Without
Date</EM>. Folio. A sound copy, but occasionally scribbled upon. The side
margins are rather closely cropt.</P>

<P>BIBLIA LATINA. 1462. Folio. 2 vols. I saw only the first volume, which
displays a well-proportioned length and breadth of margin. The
illuminations appear to be nearly coeval, and are of a soft and pleasing
style of execution. Yet the margins are rather deformed by the designation
of the chapters, in large roman numerals, of a sprawling character.</P>

<P>BIBLIA ITALICA. <EM>Kalend. de Octobrio</EM>. 1471. Folio. 2 vols. A
perfectly magnificent copy (measuring sixteen inches three eighths, by ten
and six eighths) of this very rare edition; of which a minute and
particular account will be found in the Catalogue of Earl Spencer's
Library.<A name="fnref_93"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_93">93</A> After
a careful inspection--rather than from actual comparison--I incline to
think that these noble volumes came from the press of <EM>Valdarfer</EM>.
The copy under description is bound in brown calf, with red speckled edges
to the leaves. This is a copy of an impression of which the library may
justly be proud.</P>

<P>BIBLIA POLONICA. 1599. Folio. In style of printing and embellishment
like our Coverdale's Bible of 1535. Whether it be a reprint (which is most
probable) of the famous Polish Bible of 1563, I am unable to
ascertain.</P>

<P>VIRGILIUS. <EM>Printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz</EM>. (1469.) Folio.
FIRST EDITION; of the greatest rarity. Probably this is the finest copy
(once belonging to Pius VI.) which is known to exist; but it must be
considered as imperfect--wanting the Priapeia. And yet it may be doubted
whether the latter were absolutely printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz for
their <EM>first</EM> edition? This copy, bound in white calf, with the
papal arms on the sides, measures twelves inches and a quarter in length,
by eight inches and five eighths in width: but the state of the
illumination, at the beginning of the Bucolics, shews the volume to have
been cropt--however slightly. All the illuminations are quiet and pretty.
Upon the whole, this is a very precious book; and superior in most
respects to the copy in the Royal Library.<A name="fnref_94"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_94">94</A></P>

<P>PLINIUS SENIOR. 1469. Folio. EDITIO PRINCEPS. A copy from the same
papal library; very fine, both as to length and width.--You rarely meet
with a finer copy. <EM>The Jenson edition</EM> of 1472 is here
comparatively much inferior.</P>

<P>CICERO. RHETORICA VETUS. <EM>Printed by Jenson</EM>. 1470. Folio. A
great curiosity: inasmuch as it is a copy UPON VELLUM. It has been cruelly
cut down, but the vellum is beautiful. It is also choked in the back, in
binding. From the collection of the same Pope.</P>

<P>SUETONIUS. <EM>Printed by I.P. de Lignamine</EM>. 1470. Folio. A
magnificent copy; measuring thirteen inches and one eighth in height. The
first leaf is, however, objectionable. From the same collection.</P>

<P>QUINTILIANUS. INSTITUTIONES. <EM>By the same Printer</EM>. 1470. Folio.
This and the preceding book are FIRST EDITIONS. A copy of equal beauty and
equal size with the Suetonius. From the same Collection.</P>

<P>PRISCIANUS. <EM>Printed by V. de Spira</EM>. 1470. Folio. First
Edition. We have here a truly delicious copy--UPON VELLUM--and much
superior to a similar copy in the Royal Library<A name="fnref_95"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_95">95</A> I ought slightly to notice that a few
of the leaves, following the date, are tawny, and others mended. Upon the
whole, however, this is a book which rejoices the eye and warms the heart
of a classical bibliographer. It is bound in pale calf, with gilt stamped
edges, and once belonged to the Pontiff from whose library almost every
previously-described volume was obtained.</P>

<P>DANTE. <EM>Printed by Petrus [Adam de Michaelibus.] Mantua</EM>. 1472.
Folio. A large and fair copy of an exceedingly rare edition. It appears to
be quite perfect.</P>

<P>BOETIUS. <EM>Printed by Frater Iohannes</EM> 1474. 4to. It is for the
first time that I open the leaves of this scarce edition. It is printed in
a sharp and rather handsome roman type, and this copy has sixty-three
numbered leaves.</P>

<P>ANTHOLOGIA GRÆCA. 1498. 4to. We have here a most desirable copy--UPON
VELLUM, which is equally soft and white. It has been however peppered a
little by a worm, at the beginning and end; especially at the end. It is
coated in a goodly sort ofGaignat binding.</P>

<P>CICERONIS OPERA OMNIA. <EM>Milan</EM>. 1498. Folio. 4 vols. This is the
finest copy of this rare set of volumes which it has been my lot yet to
examine; but the dedication of the printer, Minutianus, to I.I.
Trivulcius, on the reverse of the first leaf of the first volume, is
unluckily wanting. There are, who would call this a <EM>large paper</EM>
copy.</P>

<P>MARSILIUS FICINUS: IN DIONYSIUM AREOPAGITAM. <EM>Printed by Laurentius,
the Son of Franciscus a Venetian; at Florence. Without Date</EM>. Folio.
This is certainly a very beautiful and genuine book, in this particular
condition--UPON VELLUM--but the small gothic type, in which it is printed,
is a good deal blurred. The binding is in its first state: in a deep
red-coloured leather, over boards. I should apprehend this impression to
be chiefly valuable on the score of rarity and high price, when it is
found upon vellum.</P>

<P>The foregoing are what I selected from the <EM>Fifteeners</EM>; after
running an attentive eye over the shelves upon which the books, of that
description are placed. In the same case or division where these
Fifteeners are lodged, there happen to be a few <EM>Alduses</EM>, UPON
VELLUM--so beautiful, rare, and in such uncommon condition, that I
question whether M. Van Praet doth not occasionally cast an envious eye
upon these membranaceous treasures--secretly, and perhaps commendably,
wishing that some of them may one day find their way into the Royal
Collection!... You shall judge for yourself.</P>

<P>HOMERI OPERA. Gr. <EM>Printed by Aldus. Without date</EM>. 12mo. 2
vols. First Aldine impression; and this copy perhaps yields only to the
one in the Royal Library.<A name="fnref_96"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_96">96</A> These volumes are differently bound; but of the two, that
containing the <EM>Iliad</EM>, gains in length what it loses in breadth.
The vellum is equally soft, white, and well-conditioned; and perhaps,
altogether, the copy is only one little degree inferior to that in the
Royal Library. The Odyssey is bound in old red morocco, with stampt gilt
edges. This copy was purchased from the Salviati Library.</P>

<P>CICERONIS ORATIONES. <EM>Printed at the Aldine Press</EM>. 1519. 8vo. 3
vols. Surely this copy is the <EM>ne plus ultra</EM> of a VELLUM ALDUS! In
size, condition, and colour, nothing can surpass it. When I say this, I am
not unmindful of the Royal copies here, and more particularly of the
<EM>Pindar and Ovid</EM> in St. James's Place. But, in truth, there reigns
throughout the rectos and reverses of each of these volumes, such a
mellow, quiet, and genuine tone of colour, that the most knowing
bibliographer and the most fastidious Collector cannot fail to express his
astonishment on turning over the leaves. They are bound in old red
morocco, with the arms of a Cardinal on the exterior; and (with the
exception of the first volume, which is some <EM>very</EM> little shorter)
full six inches and a half, by four inches. Shew me its like if you
can!</P>

<P>I shall mention only three more volumes; but neither of them Aldine;
and then take leave of the library of Ste. Geneviève.</P>

<P>MISSALE MOZARABICUM. 1500. Folio. A fine copy for size and colour; but
unluckily much wormed at the beginning, though a little less so at the
end. It measures nearly thirteen inches one quarter, by nine three
eighths. From the stamped arms of three stars and three lizards, this copy
appears to have belonged to the <EM>Cardinal Juigné</EM>, Archbishop of
Paris; who had a fine taste for early printed books.</P>

<P>VITRUVIUS, <EM>Printed by the Giunti</EM>, 1513. 8vo. A delicious copy;
upon white, soft, spotless VELLUM. I question if it be not superior to Mr.
Dent's;<A name="fnref_97"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_97">97</A> as it
measures six inches and three-quarters, by four. A cruel worm, however,
has perforated as far as folio 76; leaving one continued hole behind him.
The binding of this exquisite book is as gaudy as it is vulgar.</P>

<P>TEWERDANCKHS. <EM>Printed in 1517</EM>. Folio. First Edition. This is
doubtless a fine copy--upon thick, but soft and white, VELLUM. Fortunately
the plates are uncoloured, and the copy is quite complete in the table. It
measures fifteen inches in length, by nine inches three quarters in
width.</P>

<P>Such appeared to me, on a tolerably careful examination of the titles
of the volumes, to be among the chief treasures in the early and more
curious department of books belonging to the STE. GENEVIÈVE LIBRARY.
Without doubt, many more may be added; but I greatly suspect that the
learned in bibliography would have made pretty nearly a similar selection;
Frequently, during the progress of my examinations, I looked out of window
upon the square, or area, below--which was covered at times by numerous
little parties of youths (from the College of Henry IV.) who were
partaking of all manner of amusements, characteristic of their ages and
habits. With, and without, coats--walking, sitting, or running,--there
they were! All gay, all occupied, all happy:--unconscious of the alternate
miseries and luxuries of the <STRONG>Bibliomania</STRONG>!--unknowing in
the nice distinctions of type from the presses of <EM>George Laver</EM>,
<EM>Schurener de Bopardia</EM>, and <EM>Adam Rot</EM>: uninitiated in the
agonising mysteries of rough edges, large margins, and original bindings!
But ...</P>

<P CLASS="poetry">Where ignorance is bliss<BR>
'Tis folly to be wise.</P>

<P>This is soberly quoted--not meaning thereby to scratch the cuticle, or
ruffle the temper, of a single Roxburgher. And now, my friend, as we are
about to quit this magnificent assemblage of books, I owe it to
myself--but much more to your own inextinguishable love of bibliographical
history--to say "one little word, or two"--ere we quit the
threshold--respecting the Abbé MERCIER SAINT LÉGER ... the head librarian,
and great living ornament of the collection, some fifty years ago. I am
enabled to do this with the greater propriety, as my friend M. Barbier is
in possession of a number of literary anecdotes and notices respecting the
Abbé--and has supplied me with a brochure, by Chardon De La Rochette,
which contains a notice of the life and writings of the character in
question. I am sure you will be interested by the account, limited and
partial as it must necessarily be: especially as I have known those, to
whose judgments I always defer with pleasure and profit, assert, that, of
all BIBLIOGRAPHERS, the Abbé Mercier St. Léger was the FIRST, in eminence,
which France possessed, I have said so myself a hundred times, and I
repeat the asseveration. Yet we must not forget Niceron.</P>

<P>Mercier Saint Léger was born on the 1st of April, 1734. At fifteen
years of age, he began to consider what line of life he should follow. A
love of knowledge, and a violent passion for study and retirement,
inclined him to enter the congregation of the <EM>Chanoines
Réguliers</EM>--distinguished for men of literature; and, agreeably to
form, he went through a course of rhetoric and philosophy, before he
passed into divinity, as a resident in the Abbey <EM>de Chatrices</EM> in
the diocese of <EM>Chalons sur Marne</EM>. It was there that he laid the
foundation of his future celebrity as a literary bibliographer. He met
there the venerable CAULET, who had voluntarily resigned the bishopric of
Grenoble, to pass the remainder of his days in the abbey in question--of
which he was the titular head--in the midst of books, solitude, and
literary society. Mercier Saint Léger quickly caught the old man's eye,
and entwined himself round his heart. Approaching blindness induced the
ex-bishop to confide the care of his library to St. Léger--who was also
instructed by him in the elements of bibliography and literary history. He
taught him also that love of order and of method which are so
distinguishable in the productions of the pupil. Death, however, in a
little time separated the master from the scholar; and the latter scarcely
ever mentioned the name, or dwelt upon the virtues, of the former, without
emotions which knew of no relief but in a flood of tears. The heart of
Mercier St. Léger was yet more admirable than his head.</P>

<P>St. Léger, at twenty years of age, returned to Paris. The celebrated
Pingré was chief librarian of the Ste. GENEVIEVE COLLECTION; and St. Léger
attached himself with ardour and affection to the society and instructions
of his Principal. He became joint SECOND LIBRARIAN in 1759; when Pingré,
eminent for astronomy, departing for India to observe the transit of Venus
over the sun's disk, St. Léger was appointed to succeed him as CHIEF--and
kept the place till the year 1772. These twelve years were always
considered by St. Léger as the happiest and most profitable of his life.
During this period he lent a helping hand in abridging the <EM>Journal de
Trevoux</EM>. In September, 1764, Louis XV. laid the foundation-stone,
with great pomp and ceremony, of the new church of Ste. Geneviève. After
the ceremony, he desired to see the library of the old establishment--in
which we have both been so long tarrying. Mercier spread all the more
ancient and curious books upon the table, to catch the eye of the monarch:
who, with sundry Lords of the bed-chamber, and his <EM>own</EM> librarian
BIGNON, examined them with great attention, and received from Mercier
certain information respecting their relative value, and rarity. Every now
and then Louis turned round, and said to Bignon, "Bignon, have I got that
book in my library?" The royal librarian ... answered not a word--but
hiding himself behind CHOISEUL, the prime minister, seemed to avoid the
sight of his master. Mercier, however, had the courage and honesty to
reply, "No, Sire, that book is <EM>not</EM> in your library." The king
spent about an hour in examining the books, chatting with the librarian,
(Mercier) and informing himself on those points in which he was ignorant.
It was during this conversation, that the noble spirit of Mercier was
manifested. The building of the library of St. Victor was in a very crazy
state: it was necessary to repair it, but the public treasury could not
support that expense. "I will tell your Majesty, (said Mercier) how this
may be managed without costing you a single crown. The headship of the
Abbey of St. Victor is vacant: name a new Abbot; upon condition, each
year, of his ceding a portion of his revenue to the reparation of the
Library." If the king had had one spark of generous feeling, he would have
replied by naming Mercier to the abbey in question, and by enjoining the
strict fulfilment of his own proposition. But it was not so. Yet the
scheme was carried into effect, although others had the glory of it.
However, the king had not forgotten Mercier, nor the bibliographical
lesson which he had received in the library of Ste. Geneviève. One of
these lessons consisted in having the distinctive marks pointed out of the
famous <EM>Bible of Sixtus V</EM>. published in 1590. A short time after,
on returning from mass, along the great gallery of Versailles, Louis saw
the head librarian of Ste. Geneviève among the spectators.. and turning to
his prime minister, exclaimed "Choiseul, how can one distinguish the
<EM>true</EM> Bible of Sixtus V.?" "Sire, (replied the unsuspecting
minister) I never was acquainted with that book." Then, addressing himself
to Mercier, the king repeated to him--without the least hesitation or
inaccuracy--the lesson which he had learnt in the library of Ste.
Geneviève. There are few stories, I apprehend, which redound so much to
this king's credit.</P>

<P>Louis gave yet more substantial proofs of his respect for his
bibliographical master, by appointing him, at the age of thirty-two, to
the headship of the abbey of <EM>St. Léger de Soissons</EM>--and hence our
hero derives his name. In 1772 Mercier surrendered the Ste. Geneviève
library to Pingré, on his return from abroad--and in the privacy of his
own society, set about composing his celebrated <EM>Supplément à
l'Histoire de l'Imprimerie par Prosper Marchand</EM>--of which the second
edition, in 1775, is not only more copious but more correct. The Abbé
Rive, who loved to fasten his teeth in every thing that had credit with
the world, endeavoured to shake the reputation of this performance.. but
in vain. Mercier now travelled abroad; was received every where with
banqueting and caresses; a distinction due to his bibliographical
merits--and was particularly made welcome by Meerman and Crevenna. M.
Ochéda, Earl Spencer's late librarian--and formerly librarian to
Crevenna--has often told me how pleased he used to be with Mercier's
society and conversation during his visit to Crevenna. On his return,
Mercier continued his work, too long suspended, upon the LATIN POETS OF
THE MIDDLE AGE. His object was, to give a brief biography of each; an
analysis of their works, with little brilliant extracts and piquant
anecdotes; traits of history little known; which, say Chardon De La
Rochette and M. Barbier, (who have read a great part of the original MS.)
"are as amusing as they are instructive."</P>

<P>But the Revolution was now fast approaching, and the meek spirit of
Mercier could ill sustain the shock of such a frightful calamity. Besides,
he loved his country yet dearer than his books. His property became
involved: his income regularly diminished; and even his privacy was
invaded. In 1792 a decree passed the convention for issuing a "Commission
for the examination of monuments." Mercier was appointed one of the
thirty-three members of which the commission was composed, and the famous
Barrère was also of the number. Barrère, fertile in projects however
visionary and destructive, proposed to Mercier, as a <EM>bright
thought</EM>, "to make a short extract from every book in the national
library: to have these extracts superbly printed by Didot;--and to ...
BURN ALL THE BOOKS FROM WHICH THEY WERE TAKEN!" It never occurred to this
revolutionising idiot that there might be a <EM>thousand</EM> copies of
the <EM>same work</EM>, and that some hundreds of these copies might be
OUT of the national library! Of course, Mercier laughed at the project,
and made the projector ashamed of it.<A name="fnref_98"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_98">98</A> Robespierre, rather fiend than man, now ruled
the destinies of France. On the 7th of July, 1794, Mercier happened to be
passing along the streets when he saw <EM>sixty-seven human beings</EM>
about to undergo the butchery of the GUILLOTINE. Every avenue was crowded
by spectators--who were hurrying towards the horrid spectacle. Mercier was
carried along by the torrent; but, having just strength enough to raise
his head, he looked up.. and beheld his old and intimate friend the
ex-abbé ROGER.. in the number of DEVOTED VICTIMS! That sight cost him his
life. A sudden horror.. followed by alternate shiverings, and flushings of
heat.. immediately seized him. A cold perspiration hung upon his brow. He
was carried into the house of a stranger. His utterance became feeble and
indistinct, and it seemed as if the hand of death were already upon
him.</P>

<P>Yet he rallied awhile. His friends came to soothe him. Hopes were
entertained of a rapid and perfect recovery. He even made a few little
visits to his friends in the vicinity of Paris. But.. his fine full figure
gradually shrunk: the colour as gradually deserted his cheek--and his eye
sensibly lacked that lustre which it used to shed upon all around. His
limbs became feeble, and his step was both tremulous and slow. He lingered
five years.. and died at ten at night, on the 13th of May 1799, just upon
the completion of his jubilee of his bibliographical toil. What he left
behind, as annotations, both in separate papers, and on the margins of
books, is prodigious. M. Barbier shewed me his projected <EM>third</EM>
edition of the <EM>Supplément to Marchand</EM>, and a copy of the
<EM>Bibliothèque Françoise of De La Croix du Maine</EM>, &amp;c. covered,
from one end to the other, with marginal notes by him.<A name=
"fnref_99"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_99">99</A> That amiable
biographer also gave me one of his little bibliographical notices, as a
specimen of his hand writing and of his manner of pursuing his
enquiries.<A name="fnref_100"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_100">100</A></P>

<P>Such are the feelings, and such the gratifications; connected with a
view of the LIBRARY of STE. GENEVIÈVE. Whenever I visit it, I imagine that
the gentle spirit of MERCIER yet presides there; and that, as it is among
the most ancient, so is it among the most interesting, of BOOK LOCALS in
Paris.</P>

<P>Come away with me, now, to a rival collection of books--in the MAZARINE
COLLEGE, or Institute. Of the magnificence of the exterior of this
building I have made mention in a previous letter. My immediate business
is with the interior; and more especially with that portion of it which
relates to <EM>paper</EM> and <EM>print</EM>. You are to know, however,
that this establishment contains <EM>two Libraries</EM>; one, peculiar to
the Institute, and running at right angles with the room in which the
members of that learned body assemble: the other, belonging to the
College, to the left, on entering the first square--from the principal
front.</P>

<P>The latter is the <EM>old</EM> collection, of the time of Cardinal
Mazarin, and with <EM>that</EM> I begin. It is deposited chiefly on the
first floor; in two rooms running at right angles with each other: the
two, about 140 feet long. These rooms may be considered very lofty;
certainly somewhat more elevated than those in the Royal Library. The
gallery is supported by slender columns, of polished oak, with Corinthian
capitals. The general appearance is airy and imposing. A huge globe, eight
feet in diameter, is in the centre of the angle where the two rooms meet.
The students read in either apartment: and, as usual, the greatest order
and silence prevail. But not a <EM>Fust and Schoiffher</EM>--nor a
<EM>Sweynheym and Pannartz</EM>--nor an <EM>Ulric Han</EM>--in this lower
region ... although they say the collection contains about 90,000 volumes.
What therefore is to be done? The attendant sees your misery, and
approaches: "Que desirez vous, Monsieur?" That question was balm to my
agitated spirits. "Are the old and more curious books deposited here?" "Be
seated, Sir. You shall know in an instant." Away goes this obliging
creature, and pulls a bell by the side of a small door. In a minute, a
gentleman, clothed in black--the true bibliographical attire--descends.
The attendant points to me: we approach each other: "A la bonne heure--je
suis charmé...." You will readily guess the remainder. "Donnez vous la
peine de monter." I followed my guide up a small winding stair-case, and
reached the topmost landing place. A succession of small rooms--(I think
<EM>ten</EM> in number) lined with the <EM>true</EM> furniture, strikes my
astonished eye, and makes warm my palpitating heart. "This is
charming"--exclaimed I, to my guide, Monsieur Thiebaut--"this is as it
should be." M. Thieubaut bowed graciously.</P>

<P>The floors are all composed of octagonal, deeply-tinted red, tiles: a
little too highly glazed, as usual; but cool, of a good picturesque tint,
and perfectly harmonising with the backs of the books. The first little
room which you gain, contains a plaster-bust of the late Abbé HOOKE,<A
name="fnref_101"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_101">101</A> who lived
sometime in England with the good Cardinal----. His bust faces another of
Palissot. You turn to the right, and obtain the first foreshortened view
of the "ten little chambers" of which I just spoke. I continued to
accompany my guide: when, reaching the <EM>first</EM> of the last
<EM>three</EM> rooms, he turned round and bade me remark that these last
three rooms were devoted exclusively to "books printed in the
<EM>Fifteenth Century</EM>: of which they possessed about fifteen
hundred." This intelligence recruited my spirits; and I began to look
around with eagerness. But alas! although the crop was plentiful, a deadly
blight had prevailed. In other words, there was number without choice:
quantity rather than quality. Yet I will not be ill-natured; for, on
reaching the third of these rooms, and the last in the suite, Monsieur
Thiebaut placed before me the following select articles.</P>

<P>BIBLIA LATINA. <EM>Printed by Fust and Schoiffher: Without Date, but
supposed to be in the year 1455 or 1456</EM>. Folio. 2 vols. For the last
dozen years of my life, I had earnestly desired to see this copy: not
because I had heard much of its beauty, but because it is the
<EM>identical</EM> copy which gave rise to the calling of this impression
the MAZARINE BIBLE.<A name="fnref_102"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_102">102</A> Certainly, all those copies which I had previously
seen--and they cannot be fewer than ten or twelve--were generally
superior; nor must this edition be henceforth designated as "of the very
first degree of rarity."</P>

<P>BIBLIA LATINA. <EM>Printed by the Same</EM>, 1462. Folio. 2 vols. A
fair, sound, large copy: UPON VELLUM. The date is printed in red, at the
end of each volume--a variety, which is not always observable. This copy
is in red morocco binding.</P>

<P>BIBLIA ITALICA. <EM>Printed by Vindelin de Spira, Kalend. August.
1471</EM>. Folio. 2 vols. A fine copy of an extremely rare edition;
perhaps the rarest of all those of the early Italian versions of the
Bible. It is in calf binding, but cropt a little.</P>

<P>LEGENDA SANCTORUM. Italicè. "<EM>Impresse per Maestro Nicolo ienson,
&amp;c. Without Date</EM>. Folio. The author of the version is
<EM>Manerbi</EM>: and the present is the <EM>first impression</EM> of it.
It is executed in double columns, in the usually delicate style of
printing by Jenson: and this volume is doubtless among the rarer
productions of the printer.</P>

<P>SERVIUS IN VIRGILIUM. <EM>Printed by Ulric Han. Without Date</EM>.
Folio. This is a volume of the most unquestionable rarity; and
<EM>such</EM> a copy of it as that now before me, is of most uncommon
occurrence.<A name="fnref_103"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_103">103</A>
Can this be surprising, when I tell you that it once belonged to Henri II.
and Diane de Poictiers! The leaves absolutely talk to you, as you turn
them over. Yet why do I find it in my heart to tell you that, towards the
middle, many leaves are stained at the top of the right margin?! There are
also two worm holes towards the end. But what then? The sun has its
spots.</P>

<P>PLAUTUS. 1472. Folio. Editio Princeps. Although <EM>this</EM> volume
came also from the collection of the <EM>illustrious Pair</EM> to whom the
previous one belonged, yet is it unworthy of such owners. I suspect it has
been cropt in its second binding. It is stained all through, at top, and
the three introductory leaves are cruelly repellent.</P>

<P>CÆSAR. 1469. Folio. Editio Princeps. A very fine, genuine copy; in the
original binding--such as all Sweynheym and Pannartz's <EM>ought</EM> to
be. It is tall and broad: but has been unluckily too much written
upon.</P>

<P>LACTANTIUS. 1470. <EM>By the same Printers</EM>. Perhaps, upon the
whole, the finest copy of this impression which exists. Yet a love of
truth compels me to observe--only in a very slight sound, approaching to a
whisper--that there are indications of the ravages of the worm, both at
the beginning and end; but very, very trivial. It is bound like the
preceding volume; and measures thirteen inches and nearly three quarters,
by about nine inches and one eighth.</P>

<P>CICERO DE OFFICIIS. 1466. 4to. Second Edition, upon paper; and
therefore rare. But this copy is sadly stained and wormed.</P>

<P>CICERO DE NATURA DEORUM, &amp;c. <EM>Printed by Vindelin de
Spiraa</EM>. 1471. Folio. A fine sound copy, in the original binding.</P>

<P>SILIUS ITALICUS. <EM>Printed by Laver</EM>. 1471. Folio. A good, sound
copy; and among the very rarest books from the press of Laver, in such
condition.</P>

<P>CATULLUS, TIBULLUS, ET PROPERTIUS. 1472. Folio. The knowing, in early
classical bibliography, are aware that this <EM>Editio Princeps</EM> is
perhaps to be considered as only <EM>one</EM> degree below the first
impressions of Lucretius and Virgil in rarity. The longest life may pass
away without an opportunity of becoming the purchaser of such a treasure.
The present is a tall, fair copy; quite perfect. In red morocco
binding.</P>

<P>DANTE. <EM>Printed by Numeister</EM>. 1472. Folio. Considered to be the
earliest impression. This is rather a broad than a tall copy; and not free
from stain and the worm. But it is among the very best copies which I have
seen.</P>

<HR>
<P>It will not be necessary to select more flowers from this choice corner
of the tenth and last room of the upper suite of apartments: nor am I sure
that, upon further investigation, the toil would be attended with any very
productive result. Yet I ought not to omit observing to you that this
Library owes its chief celebrity to the care, skill, and enthusiasm of the
famous <EM>Gabriel Naudé</EM>, the first librarian under the Cardinal its
founder. Of Naudé, you may have before read somewhat in certain
publications;<A name="fnref_104"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_104">104</A> where his praises are set forth with no sparing hand. He
was perhaps never excelled in activity, bibliographical
<EM>diplomacy</EM>, or zeal for his master; and his expressive countenance
affords the best index of his ardent mind. He purchased every where, and
of all kinds, of bodies corporate and of individuals. But you must not
imagine that the <EM>Mazarine Library</EM>, as you now behold it, is
precisely of the same dimensions, or contains the same books, as formerly.
If many rare and precious volumes have been disposed of, or are missing,
or lost, many have been also procured. The late librarian was LUCAS JOSEPH
HOOKE, and the present is Mons. PETIT RADEL.<A name="fnref_105"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_105">105</A> We will descend, therefore, from
these quiet and congenial regions; and passing through the lower rooms,
seek the <EM>other</EM> collection of books attached to this
establishment.</P>

<P>The library, which is more immediately appropriated to the INSTITUTE OF
FRANCE, may consist of 20,000 volumes,<A name="fnref_106"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_106">106</A> and is contained in a long room--perhaps of
one hundred feet--of which the further extremity is supposed to be
<EM>adorned</EM> by a statue of VOLTAIRE. This statue is raised within a
recess, and the light is thrown upon it from above from a concealed
window. Of all deviations from good taste, this statue exhibits one of the
most palpable. Voltaire, who was as thin as a hurdle, and a mere bag of
bones, is here represented as an almost <EM>naked</EM> figure, sitting: a
slight mantle over his left arm being the only piece of drapery which the
statue exhibits. The poet is slightly inclining his head to the left,
holding a pen in his right hand. The countenance has neither the fire,
force, nor truth, which Denon's terra-cotta head of the poet seems to
display. The extremities are meagre and offensive. In short, the whole, as
it appears to me, has an air approaching the burlesque. Opposite to this
statue are the colossal busts of LA-GRANGE and MALESHERBES; while those of
PEIRESC and FRANKLIN are nearly of the size of nature. They are all in
white marble. That of Peiresc has considerable expression.</P>

<P>This may be called a collection of <EM>Books of Business</EM>; in other
words, of books of almost every day's reference--which every one may
consult. It is particularly strong in <EM>Antiquities</EM> and
<EM>History</EM>: and for the latter, it is chiefly indebted to Dom
Brial--the living father of French history<A name="fnref_107"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_107">107</A>--that excellent and able man (who is
also one of the Secretaries of the Institute) having recommended full
two-thirds of the <EM>long sets</EM> (as they are called) which relate to
ancient history. The written catalogue is contained in fourteen folio
volumes, interleaved; there being generally only four articles written in
a page, and those four always upon the recto of each leaf. This is a good
plan: for you may insert your acquisitions, with the greatest convenience,
for a full dozen years to come. No <EM>printed</EM> catalogue of either of
these libraries, or of those of the Arsenal and Ste. Geneviève, exists:
which I consider to be a <EM>stain</EM>--much more frightful than that
which marks the copy of the "<EM>Servius in Virgilium</EM>," just before
described!</P>

<P>It remains now to make mention of a <EM>third</EM> Collection of
Books-- which may be considered in the light both of a public and a
private Library. I mean, the Collection appropriated more particularly for
the <EM>King's private use</EM>,<A name="fnref_108"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_108">108</A> and which is deposited beneath the long gallery of
the Louvre. Its local is as charming as it is peculiar. You walk by the
banks of the Seine, in a line with the south side of the Louvre, and gain
admittance beneath an archway, which is defended by an iron grating. An
attendant, in the royal livery, opens the door of the library--just after
you have ascended above the entresol. You enquire "whether Monsieur
BARBIER, the chief Librarian, be within?" "Sir, he is never absent. Be
pleased to go straight forward, as far as you can see."<A name=
"fnref_109"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_109">109</A> What a sight is
before me! Nothing less than <EM>thirteen</EM> rooms, with a small arched
door in the centre, through which I gaze as if looking through a tube.
Each of these rooms is filled with books; and in one or the other of them
are assembled the several visitors who come to read. The whole is
perfectly magical. Meanwhile the nephew of M. Barbier walks quickly, but
softly, from one room to another, to take down the several volumes
enquired after. At length, having paced along upwards of 200 feet of
glazed red tile, and wondering when this apparently interminable suite of
apartments will end, I view my estimable friend, the HEAD LIBRARIAN deeply
occupied in some correction of Bayle or of Moreri--sitting at the further
extremity. His reception of me is more than kind. It is hearty and
enthusiastic.</P>

<P>"Now that I am in this magical region, my good friend, allow me to
inspect the famous PRAYER BOOK of CHARLEMAGNE?"--was my first solicitation
to Mons. Barbier. "Gently,"--said my guide. "You are almost asking to
partake of forbidden fruit. But I suppose you must not be disappointed."
This was only sharpening the edge of my curiosity--for "wherefore this
mystery, good M. Barbier?" "<EM>That</EM> you may know another time. The
book is here: and you shall immediately inspect it."--was his reply. M.
Barbier unlocked the recess in which it is religiously preserved; took off
the crimson velvet in which it is enveloped; and springing backward only
two feet and a half, exclaimed, on presenting it, "Le voilà--dans toute sa
beauté pristine." I own that I even forgot <EM>Charles the Bald</EM>--and
eke his imperial brother <EM>Lotharius</EM>,<A name="fnref_110"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_110">110</A>--as I gazed upon the contents of it.
With these contents it is now high time that you should be made
acquainted.</P>

<P>EVANGELISTARIUM, or PRAYER BOOK--once belonging to CHARLEMAGNE. Folio.
The subject-matter of this most precious book is thus arranged. In the
first place, there are five large illuminations, of the entire size of the
page, which are much discoloured. The first four represent the
<EM>Evangelists</EM>: each sitting upon a cushion, not unlike a bolster.
The fifth is the figure of our SAVIOUR. The back ground is purple: the
pillow-like seat, upon which Christ sits, is scarlet, relieved by white
and gold. The upper garment of the figure is dark green: the lower,
purple, bordered in part with gold. The foot-stool is gold: the book, in
the left hand, is red and gold: the arabesque ornaments, in the border,
are blue, red, and gold. The hair of our Saviour is intended to be
flaxen.</P>

<P>The text is in double columns, upon a purple ground, within an
arabesque border of red, purple, yellow, and bluish green. It is uniformly
executed in letters of gold, of which the surface is occasionally rather
splendid. It consists of a series of gospel extracts, for the whole year,
amounting to about two hundred and forty-two. These extracts terminate
with "<EM>Et ego resuscitabo eum in novissimo die. Amen</EM>"</P>

<P>Next comes a Christian Calendar, from the dominical year Dcclxxv. to
Dccxcvii. On casting the eye down these years, and resting it on that of
Dcclxxxi, you observe, in the columns of the opposite leaf, this very
important entry, or memorandum--in the undoubted writing of the time:
"<EM>In isto Anno ivit Dominus</EM>, REX KAROLUS, <EM>ad scm Petrvm et
baptisatus est filius eius</EM> PIPPINUS <EM>a Domino Apostolico</EM>;"
from which I think it is evident (as is observed in the account of this
precious volume in the <EM>Annales Encyclopédiques</EM>, vol. iii. p. 378)
that this very book was commanded to be written chiefly to perpetuate a
notice of the baptism, by Pope Adrian, of the emperor's son PIPPIN.<A
name="fnref_111"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_111">111</A> There is no
appearance whatever of fabrication, in this memorandum. The whole is
coeval, and doubtless of the time when it is professed to have been
executed. The last two pages are occupied by Latin verses, written in a
lower-case, cursive hand; but contemporaneous, and upon a purple ground.
From these verses we learn that the last scribe, or copyist, of the text
of this splendid volume, was one GODESCALE, or GODSCHALCUS, a German. The
verses are reprinted in the <EM>Décades Philosophiques</EM>.</P>

<P>This MS. was given to the <EM>Abbey of St. Servin</EM>, at Toulouse;
and it was religiously preserved there, in a case of massive silver,
richly embossed, till the year 1793; when the silver was stolen, and the
book carried off, with several precious relics of antiquity, by order of
the President of the Administration, (Le Sieur S*****) and thrown into a
magazine, in which were many other vellum MSS. destined ... TO BE BURNT!
One's blood curdles at the narrative. There it lay--- expecting its
melancholy fate; till a Monsieur de Puymaurin, then detained as a prisoner
in the magazine, happened to throw his eye upon the precious volume; and,
writing a certain letter about it, to a certain quarter--(which letter is
preserved in the fly leaves, but of which I was denied the transcription,
from motives of delicacy--) an order was issued by government for the
conveyance of the MS. to the metropolis. This restoration was effected in
May 1811.<A name="fnref_112"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_112">112</A> I
think you must admit, that, in every point of view, THIS MS. ranks among
the most interesting and curious, as well as the most ancient, of those in
the several libraries of Paris.</P>

<P>But this is the <EM>only</EM> piece of antiquity, of the book kind, in
the Library. Of modern performances, I ought to mention a French version
of OSSIAN, in quarto, which was the favourite reading book of the
ex-Emperor; and to which Isabey, at his express command, prefixed a
frontispiece after the design of Gérard. This frontispiece is beautifully
and tenderly executed: a group of heroes, veiled in a mist, forms the
back-ground. The only other modern curiosity, in this way, which I deem it
necessary to notice, is a collection of ORIGINAL DRAWINGS of flowers, in
water colours, by RÉDOUTÉ, upon vellum: in seven folio volumes; and which
cost 70,000 francs.<A name="fnref_113"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_113">113</A> Nothing can exceed--and very few efforts of the pencil
can equal--this wonderful performance. Such a collection were reasonable
at the fore-mentioned price.</P>

<P>And now, my good friend, suppose I furnish you with an outline of the
worthy head-librarian himself? A.A. BARBIER has perhaps not long "turned
the corner" of his fiftieth year. Peradventure he may be fifty three.<A
name="fnref_114"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_114">114</A> In stature,
he is above the middle height, but not very tall. In form, he is robust;
and his countenance expressive of great conciliatoriness and benignity.
There is a dash of the "old school" about the attire of M. Barbier, which
I am Goth enough to admire: while his ardour of conversation, and rapidity
of utterance, relieved by frequent and expressive smiles, make his
society, equally agreeable and instructive. He is a literary bibliographer
to the very back bone; and talks of what he has done, and of what he
purposes to do, with a "gaieté de coeur" which is quite delightful. He is
now engaged in an <EM>Examen Critique et Complément des Dictionnaires
Historiques les plus repandus</EM>;<A name="fnref_115"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_115">115</A> while his <EM>Dictionnaire des Auteurs
Anonymes et Pseudonymes</EM>, in 4 vols. 8vo., and his <EM>Bibliothéque
d'un Homme de gout</EM>," in five similar volumes, have already placed him
in the foremost rank of French bibliographers. Such is his attention to
the duties of his situation, as Librarian, that from one year's end to the
other, with the exception of Sundays, he has <EM>no holiday</EM>. His
home-occupations, after the hours of public employment (from twelve to
four) are over, are not less unintermitting--in the pursuits of literary
bibliography.</P>

<P>It was at this home, that M. Barbier shewed me, in his library, some of
the fruits of his long and vigorously pursued "travail." He possesses
Mercier Saint Léger's own copy of his intended <EM>third</EM> edition of
the <EM>Supplement to Marchand's History of Printing</EM>. It is, in
short, the second edition, covered with ms. notes in the hand-writing of
Mercier himself.<A name="fnref_117"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_117">117</A> He also possesses (but as the property of the Royal
Library) the same eminent bibliographer's copy of the <EM>Bibliothèque
Française De La Croix du Maine</EM>, in six volumes, covered in like
manner with ms. notes by the same hand. To a man of M. Barbier's keen
literary appetite, this latter must prove an inexhaustible feast. I was
shewn, in this same well-garnished, but unostentatious collection,
GOUJET'S own catalogue of his own library. It is in six folio volumes;
well written; with a ruled frame work round each page, and an ornamental
frontispiece to the first volume. Every book in the catalogue has a note
subjoined; and the index is at once full and complete.<A name=
"fnref_118"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_118">118</A> M. Barbier has
rather a high notion, and with justice, of Goujet: observing to me, that
<EM>five</EM> volumes, out of the <EM>ten</EM> of the last edition of
Moreri's Dictionary--which were edited by Goujet--as well as his
<EM>Bibliothéque Française</EM>, in eighteen duodecimo volumes--entitled
him to the lasting gratitude of posterity. On my remarking that the want
of an index, to this <EM>latter</EM> work, was a great drawback to the use
which might be derived from it, M.B. readily coincided with me--and hoped
that a projected new edition would remedy this defect. M.B. also told me
that Goujet was the editor of the <EM>Dictionnaire de Richelet</EM>, of
1758, in three folio volumes--which had escaped my recollection.</P>

<P>My first visit to M. Barbier was concluded by his begging my acceptance
of a copy of the <EM>first edition of Phædrus</EM>, in 1596, 12mo.; which
contained, bound up with it, a copy of the <EM>second</EM> edition of
1600; with various readings to the <EM>latter</EM>, from a MS. which was
burnt in 1774. This gift was expressly intended for Lord Spencer's
library, and in a few months from hence (as I have previously apprized his
Lordship) it shall "repose upon the shelves" of his Collection.<A name=
"fnref_119"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_119">119</A></P>

<P>It is now high time to relieve you; as you must begin to be almost
wearied with BIBLIOGRAPHY. You have indeed, from the tenor of these five
last letters, been made acquainted with some of the chief treasures in the
principal libraries of Paris. You have wandered with me through a world of
books; and have been equally, with myself, astonished and delighted with
what has been placed before you. Here, then, I drop the subject of
bibliography--only to be resumed as connected with an account of book-
men.</P>

<H3 class="letter">[INTRODUCTION TO LETTER VIII.]</H3>

<P>Before entering upon the perusal of this memorable Letter--which, in
the previous edition, was numbered LETTER XXX,--(owing to the Letters
having been numbered consecutively from the beginning to the end) I
request the Reader's attention to a few preliminary remarks, which may
possibly guide him to form a more correct estimate of its real character.
MONS. LICQUET having published a French version of my Ninth Letter,
descriptive of the Public Library at Rouen, (and to which an allusion has
been made in vol. i. p. 99.) MONS. CRAPELET (see p. 1, ante) undertook a
version of the <EM>ensuing</EM> Letter: of which he printed <EM>one
hundred copies</EM>. Both translations were printed in M. Crapelet's
office, to arrange, in type and form of publication, as much as possible
with my own; so that, if the <EM>intrinsic</EM> merit of these versions
could not secure purchasers, the beauty of the paper and of the press work
(for both are very beautiful) might contribute to their circulation. To
the version of M. Crapelet<A name="fnref_120"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_120">120</A> was prefixed a <EM>Preface</EM>, combining such a
mixture of malignity and misconception, that I did not hesitate answering
it, in a privately printed tract, entitled "A ROLAND FOR AN OLIVER." Of
this Tract, "only <EM>thirty-six copies were printed</EM>." "So much the
better for the Author"--says M. Crapelet. The sequel will shew.</P>

<P>In the publication of the <EM>entire</EM> version of my Tour, by M.M.
Licquet and Crapelet, the translation of this VIIIth Letter appears as it
did in the previous publication--with the exception of the omission of the
<EM>Preface</EM>: but in lieu of which, there is another and a short
preface, by M. Crapelet, to the third volume, where, after telling his
readers that his previous attempt had excited my "holy wrath," he seems to
rejoice in the severity of those criticisms, which, in certain of our
<EM>own</EM> public Journals, have been passed upon my subsequent
bibliographical labours. With these criticisms I have here nothing to do.
If the authors of them can reconcile them to their own good sense and
subsequent reflections, and the Public to their own INDEPENDENCE of
JUDGMENT, the voice of remonstrance will be ineffectual. Time will strike
the balance between the Critic and the Author: and without pretending to
explore the mysteries of an occasional <EM>getting-up</EM> of Reviews of
particular articles, I think I can speak in the language of justice, as
well as of confidence, of the Author of ONE of these reviews, by a
quotation from the <EM>Ajax Flagellifer</EM> of SOPHOCLES.</P>

<P>To return to M. Crapelet; and to have done with him. The
<EM>motive</EM> for his undertaking the version of this memorable Letter,
about "BOOKSELLERS, PRINTERS, and BOOKBINDERS at Paris," seems to be
wholly inconceivable; since the logic of the undertaking would be as
follows. BECAUSE I have spoken favourably of the whole typographical
fraternity--and because, in particular, of M. Crapelet, his
<EM>Ménage</EM>, and Madame who is at the head of it--<EM>because</EM> I
have lauded his Press equally with his Cellar--THEREFORE the
"<EM>un</EM>holy wrath" of M. Crapelet is excited; and he cannot endure
the freedom taken by the English traveller. It would be abusing the
confidence reposed in me by written communications, from characters of the
first respectability, were I to make public a few of the sentiments
contained in them--expressive of surprise and contempt at the performance
of the French typographer. But in mercy to my adversary, he shall be
spared the pain of their perusal.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER VIII.</H3>

<P>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LATE ABBÉ RIVE. BOOKSELLERS. PRINTERS. BOOK-
BINDERS.</P>

<P>I make no doubt that the conclusion of my last letter has led you to
expect a renewal of the BOOK THEME: but rather, I should hope, as
connected with those Bibliographers, Booksellers, and Printers, who have
for so many years shed a sort of lustre upon <EM>Parisian Literature</EM>.
It will therefore be no unappropriate continuation of this subject, if I
commence by furnishing you with some particulars respecting a
Bibliographer who was considered, in his life time, as the terror of his
acquaintance, and the pride of his patron: and who seems to have never
walked abroad, or sat at home, without a scourge in one hand, and a
looking-glass in the other. Droll combination!--you will exclaim. But it
is of the ABBÉ RIVE of whom I now speak; the very <EM>Ajax
flagellifer</EM> of the bibliographical tribe, and at the same time the
vainest and most self-sufficient. He seems, amidst all the controversy in
which he delighted to be involved, to have always had <EM>one</EM>
never-failing source of consolation left:--that of seeing himself
favourably reflected--from the recollection of his past performances--in
the mirror of his own conceit! I have before<A name="fnref_121"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_121">121</A> descanted somewhat upon probably the
most splendid of his projected performances, and now hasten to a more
particular account of the man himself.</P>

<P>It was early one morning--before I had even commenced my
breakfast--that a stranger was announced to me. And who, think you, should
that stranger turn out to be? Nothing less than the <EM>Nephew</EM> of the
late Abbé Rive. His name was MORENAS. His countenance was somewhat like
that which Sir Thomas More describes the hero of his Utopia to have had.
It was hard, swarthy, and severe. He seemed in every respect to be "a
travelled man." But his manners and voice were mild and conciliating.
"Some one had told him that I had written about the Abbé Rive, and that I
was partial to his work. Would I do him the favour of a visit? when I
might see, at his house, (<EM>Rue du Vieux Colombier, près St.
Sulpice</EM>) the whole of the Abbé's MSS. and all his projected works for
the press. They were for sale. Possibly I might wish to possess them?" I
thanked the stranger for his intelligence, and promised I would call that
same morning.</P>

<P>M. Morenas has been indeed a great traveller. When I called, I found
him living up two pair of stairs, preparing for another voyage to Senegal.
He was surrounded by <EM>trunks</EM> ... in which were deposited the
literary remains of his uncle. In other words, these remains consisted of
innumerable <EM>cards</EM>, closely packed, upon which the Abbé had
written all his memoranda relating to ... I scarcely know what. But the
whole, from the nephew's statement, seemed to be an encyclopædia of
knowledge. In one trunk, were about <EM>six thousand</EM> notices of MSS.
of all ages; and of editions in the fifteenth century. In another trunk,
were wedged about <EM>twelve thousand</EM> descriptions of books in all
languages, except those of French and Italian, from the sixteenth century
to his own period: these were professed to be accompanied with critical
notes. In a third trunk was a bundle of papers relating to the <EM>History
of the Troubadours</EM>; in a fourth, was a collection of memoranda and
literary sketches, connected with the invention of Arts and Sciences, with
Antiquities, Dictionaries, and pieces exclusively bibliographical. A fifth
trunk contained between <EM>two and three thousand</EM> cards, written
upon on each side, respecting a collection of prints; describing the
ranks, degrees, and dignities of all nations--of which eleven folio
<EM>cahiers</EM> were published, in 1779--without the letter-press--but in
a manner to make the Abbé extremely dissatisfied with the engraver. In a
sixth trunk were contained his papers respecting earthquakes, volcanoes,
and geographical subjects: so that, you see, the Abbé Rive at least
fancied himself a man of tolerably universal attainments. It was of course
impossible to calculate the number, or to appreciate the merits, of such a
multifarious collection; but on asking M. Morenas if he had made up his
mind respecting the <EM>price</EM> to be put upon it, he answered, that he
thought he might safely demand 6000 francs for such a body of
miscellaneous information. I told him that this was a sum much beyond my
means to adventure; but that it was at least an object worthy of the
consideration of the "higher powers" of his own government. He replied,
that he had little hopes of success in those quarters: that he was anxious
to resume his travels; talked of another trip to Senegal; for that, after
so locomotive a life, a sedentary one was wearisome to him....</P>

<P CLASS="poetry">... "trahit sua quemque voluptas!"</P>

<P>Over the chimney-piece was a portrait, in pencil, of his late uncle:
done from the life. It was the only one extant. It struck me indeed as
singularly indicative of the keen, lively, penetrating talents of the
original. On the back of the portrait were the lines which are here
subjoined:</P>

<P CLASS="poetry"><EM>Dès sa plus tendre enfance aux études livré,<BR>
La soif de la science l'a toujours dévoré.<BR>
Une immense lecture enrichit ses écrits,<BR>
Et la critique sure en augmente le prix.</EM></P>

<P>These lines are copied from the <EM>Journal des Savans</EM> for October
1779. Iean Joseph Rive was born at Apt, in 1730, and died at Marseilles in
1791. He had doubtless great parts, natural and acquired: a retentive
memory, a quick perception, and a vast and varied reading. He probably
commenced amassing his literary treasures as early as his fourteenth year;
and to his latest breath he pursued his researches with unabated ardour.
But his career was embittered by broils and controversies; while the
frequent acts of kindness, and the general warmth of heart, evinced in his
conduct, hardly sufficed to soften the asperity, or to mitigate the wrath,
of a host of enemies--which assailed him to the very last. But
Cadmus-like, he sowed the seeds from which these combatants sprung.
Whatever were his defects, as a public character, he is said to have been,
in private, a kind parent, a warm friend, and an excellent master. The
only servant which he ever had, and who remained with him twenty-four
years, mourned his loss as that of a father. Peace to his ashes!</P>

<P>From bibliography let me gently, and naturally, as it were, conduct you
towards BIBLIOPOLISM. In other words, allow me to give you a sketch of a
few of the principal Booksellers in this gay metropolis; who strive, by
the sale of instructive and curious tomes, sometimes printed in the black
letter of <EM>Gourmont</EM> and <EM>Marnef</EM>, to stem the torrent of
those trivial or mischievous productions which swarm about the avenues of
the Palais Royal. In ancient times, the neighbourhood of the SORBONNE was
the great mart for books. When I dined in this neighbourhood, with my
friend M. Gail, the Greek Professor at the College Royale, I took an
opportunity of leisurely examining this once renowned quarter. I felt even
proud and happy to walk the streets, or rather tread the earth, which had
been once trodden by <EM>Gering</EM>, <EM>Crantz</EM>, and
<EM>Fiburger</EM>.<A name="fnref_122"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_122">122</A> Their spirits seemed yet to haunt the spot:--but no
volume, nor even traces of one--executed at their press--could be
discovered. To have found a perfect copy of <EM>Terence</EM>, printed in
their first Roman character, would have been a <EM>trouvaille</EM>
sufficiently lucky to have compensated for all previous toil, and to have
franked me as far as Strasbourg.</P>

<P>The principal mart for booksellers, of old and second hand books, is
now nearer the Seine; and especially in the <EM>Quai des Augustins</EM>.
<EM>Messrs. Treuttel and Würtz, Panckoucke, Renouard</EM>, and
<EM>Brunet</EM>, live within a quarter of a mile of each other: about a
couple of hundred yards from the <EM>Quai des Augustins</EM>. Further to
the south, and not far from the Hotel de Clugny, in the <EM>Rue
Serpente</EM>, live the celebrated DEBURE. They are booksellers to the
King, and to the Royal Library; and a more respectable house, or a more
ancient firm, is probably not to be found in Europe. Messrs. Debure are as
straight-forward, obliging, and correct, in their transactions, as they
are knowing in the value, and upright in the sale, of their stock in
trade. No bookseller in Paris possesses a more judicious stock, or can
point to so many rare and curious books. A young collector may rely with
perfect safety upon them; and accumulate, for a few hundred pounds, a very
respectable stock of <EM>Editiones principes</EM> or <EM>rarissimæ</EM>. I
do not say that such young collector would find them <EM>cheaper
there</EM>, or <EM>so cheap</EM> as in <EM>Pall-Mall</EM>; but I do say
that he may rest assured that Messieurs Debure would never, knowingly,
sell him an imperfect book. Of the Debure, there are two brothers: of whom
the elder hath a most gallant propensity to
<EM>portrait-collecting</EM>--and is even rich in portraits relating to
<EM>our</EM> history. Of course the chief strength lies in French history;
and I should think that Monsieur Debure l'ainé shewed me almost as many
portraits of Louis XIV. as there are editions of the various works of
Cicero in the fifteenth century.<A name="fnref_123"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_123">123</A> But my attention was more particularly directed to
a certain boudoir, up one pair of stairs, in which Madame Debure, their
venerable and excellent mother, chooses to deposit some few very choice
copies of works in almost every department of knowledge. There was about
<EM>one</EM> of the <EM>best</EM> editions in each department: and whether
it were the Bible, or the History of the Bucaineers--whether a lyrical
poet of the reign of Louis XIV. or the ballad metres of that of François
Premier ... there you found it!--bound by Padaloup, or Deseuille, or De
Rome. What think you, among these "choice copies," of the
<STRONG>Cancionero Generale</STRONG> printed at Toledo in 1527, in the
black letter, double columned, in folio? Enough to madden even our
poet-laureat--for life! I should add, that these books are not thus
carefully kept together for the sake of <EM>shew</EM>: for their owner is
a fair good linguist, and can read the Spanish with tolerable fluency.
Long may she yet read it.<A name="fnref_124"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_124">124</A></P>

<P>The Debure had the selling, by auction, of the far-famed M'CARTHY
LIBRARY; and I saw upon their shelves some of the remains of that splendid
membranaceous collection. Indeed I bought several desirable specimens of
it: among them, a fine copy of <EM>Vindelin de Spira's</EM> edition (1471)
of <EM>St. Cyprians Epistles</EM>, UPON VELLUM.<A name="fnref_125"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_125">125</A> Like their leading brethren in the
neighbourhood, Messieurs Debure keep their country house, and there pass
the Sabbath.</P>

<P>The house of TREUTTEL and WURTZ is one of the richest and one of the
most respectable in Europe. The commerce of that House is chiefly in the
wholesale way; and they are, in particular, the publishers and proprietors
of all the great classical works put forth at <EM>Strasbourg</EM>. Indeed,
it was at this latter place where the family first took root: but the
branches of their prosperity have spread to Paris and to London with
nearly equal luxuriance. They have a noble house in the <EM>Rue de
Bourbon</EM>, no. 17: like unto an hotel; where each day's post brings
them despatches from the chief towns in Europe. Their business is
regulated with care, civility, and dispatch; and their manners are at once
courteous and frank. Nothing would satisfy them but I must spend a Sabbath
with them, at their country house at <EM>Groslai</EM>; hard by the village
and vale of Montmorenci. I assented willingly. On the following Sunday,
their capacious family coach, and pair of sleek, round, fat black horses,
arrived at my lodgings by ten o'clock; and an hour and three quarters
brought me to Groslai. The cherries were ripe, and the trees were well
laden with fruit: for Montmorenci cherries, as you may have heard, are
proverbial for their excellence. I spent a very agreeable day with mine
hosts. Their house is large and pleasantly situated, and the view of Paris
from thence is rather picturesque. But I was most struck with the
conversation and conduct of Madame Treuttel. She is a thoroughly good
woman. She has raised, at her own expense, an alms-house in the village
for twelve poor men; and built a national school for the instruction of
the poor and ignorant of both sexes. She is herself a Lutheran Protestant;
as are her husband and her son-in-law M. Würtz. At first, she had some
difficulties to encounter respecting the <EM>school</EM>; and sundry
conferences with the village Curé, and some of the head clergy of Paris,
were in consequence held. At length all difficulties were surmounted by
the promise given, on the part of Madame Treuttel, to introduce only the
French version of the Bible by <EM>De Sacy</EM>. Hence the school was
built, and the children of the village flocked in numbers to it for
instruction. I visited both the alms-house and the school, and could not
withhold my tribute of hearty commendation at the generosity, and
thoroughly Christian spirit, of the foundress of such establishments.
There is more good sense and more private and public virtue, in the
application of superfluous wealth in this manner, than in the erection of
a hundred palaces like that at <EM>Versailles!</EM><A name=
"fnref_126"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_126">126</A></P>

<P>A different, and a more touching object presented itself to my view in
the garden. Walking with Madame, we came, through various détours, into a
retired and wooded part: where, on opening a sort of wicket gate, I found
myself in a small square space, with hillocks in the shape of
<EM>tumuli</EM> before me. A bench was at the extremity. It was a resting
place for the living, and a depository of the dead. Flowers, now a good
deal faded, were growing upon these little mounds--beneath which the dead
seemed to sleep in peace. "What might this mean?" "Sir," replied Madame
Treuttel, "this is consecrated ground. My son-in-law sleeps here--and his
only and beloved child lies by the side of him. You will meet my daughter,
his wife, at dinner. She, with myself, visit this spot at stated
seasons--when we renew and indulge our sorrows on the recollection of
those who sleep beneath. These are losses which the world can never
repair. We all mean to be interred within the same little fenced space.<A
name="fnref_127"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_127">127</A> I have
obtained a long lease of it--for some fifty years: at the expiration of
which time, the work of dissolution will be sufficiently complete with us
all." So spake my amiable and enlightened guide. The remainder of the
day--during which we took a stroll to Montmorenci, and saw the house and
gardens where Rousseau wrote his <EM>Emile</EM>--was spent in a mixed but
not irrational manner: much accordant with my own feelings, and most
congenial with a languid state of body which had endured the heats of
Paris for a month, without feeling scarcely a breath of air the whole
time.</P>

<P>ANTOINE-AUGUSTIN RENOUARD, living in the <EM>Rue St. André des
Arts</EM>, is the next bibliopolist whom I shall introduce to your
attention. He is among the most lynx-eyed of his fraternity: has a great
knowledge of books; a delightful ALDINE LIBRARY;<A name="fnref_128"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_128">128</A>--from which his Annals of the Aldine
Press were chiefly composed--and is withal a man in a great and successful
line of business. I should say he is a rich man; not because he has five
hundred bottles of Burgundy in his cellar, which some may think to be of a
more piquant quality than the like number of his <EM>Alduses</EM>--but
because he has published some very beautiful and expensive editions of the
Latin and French Classics, with equal credit to himself and advantage to
his finances.<A name="fnref_129"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_129">129</A> He <EM>debuted</EM> with a fine edition of
<EM>Lucan</EM> in 1795, folio; and the first catalogue of his books was
put forth the following year. From that moment to the present, he has
never slackened head, hand, or foot, in the prosecution of his business;
while the publication of his <EM>Annals of the Aldine Press</EM> places
him among the most skilful and most instructive booksellers in Europe. It
is indeed a masterly performance: and as useful as it is elegantly
printed.<A name="fnref_130"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_130">130</A> M.
Renouard is now occupied in an improved edition of <EM>Voltaire</EM>,
which he means to adorn with engravings; and of which he shewed me the
original drawings by Moreau, with many of the plates.<A name=
"fnref_131"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_131">131</A> He seems in high
spirits about the success of it, and leans with confidence upon the
strength of a host of subscribers. Nor does a rival edition, just
struggling into day, cause him to entertain less sanguine expectations of
final success. This enterprising bookseller is now also busily occupied
about a <EM>Descriptive Catalogue of his own library</EM>, in which he
means to indulge himself in sundry gossipping notes, critical
disquisitions, and piquant anecdotes. I look forward with pleasure to its
appearance; and turn a deaf ear to the whispers which have reached me of
an intended <EM>brush</EM> at the Decameron.<A name="fnref_132"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_132">132</A></P>

<P>M. Renouard has allowed me free access to his library; which also
contains some very beautiful copies of books printed in the fifteenth
century. Among these latter, his VELLUM VALDARFER is of course considered,
by himself and his friends, as the <EM>keimelion</EM> of the collection.
It is the edition of the <EM>Orations of Cicero</EM>, printed by
Valdarfer, at Venice, in 1471, folio: a most exquisite book--which may be
fairly considered as perfect throughout. It is in its second binding, but
<EM>that</EM> may be as old as the time of Francis I.: perhaps about the
middle of the sixteenth century. This copy measures thirteen inches in
height, by eight inches and seven-eighths in width:--almost, I conceive,
in its original state of amplitude. I will frankly own that I turned over
the leaves of this precious book, again and again--"sighed and looked,
&amp;c." "But would no price tempt the owner to part with it?" "None. It
is reserved as the bijou of my catalogue, and departs not from hence."
Severe, but just decree! There is only one other known copy of it upon
vellum, which is in the Royal Library<A name="fnref_133"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_133">133</A>-- but which wants a leaf of the table; an
imperfection, not belonging to the present copy.</P>

<P>The other "great guns," as VELLUM BOOKS, in the collection of M.
Renouard, are what is called the <EM>Familiar Epistles of Cicero</EM>
printed by <EM>Aldus</EM> in 1502, 12mo: and the <EM>Petrarch</EM> of
1514, 8vo. also printed by Aldus. Of these, the <EM>latter</EM> is by much
the preferable volume. It is almost as large as it can well be: but badly
bound in red morocco.<A name="fnref_134"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_134">134</A> The Cicero is short and sallow-looking. It was on the
occasion of his son starting for the first time on a bibliographical tour,
and, on crossing the Rhine, and finding this Cicero and the almost equally
rare <EM>Aldine Virgil</EM> of 1505, that a relation of this "fortunate
youth" invoked his muse in some few verses, which he printed and gave to
me.<A name="fnref_135"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_135">135</A> These
are little "plaisanteries" which give a relish to our favourite pursuits;
and which may at some future day make the son transcend the father in
bibliographical renown. Perhaps the father has already preferred a prayer
upon the subject, as thus:</P>

<P>There are some few noble volumes, from the press of <EM>Sweynheym and
Pannartz</EM>, in this collection; and the finest copy of the FIRST LUCIAN
in Greek, which perhaps any where exists.<A name="fnref_136"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_136">136</A> It was obtained at a recent sale, (where it
was coated in a lapping-over vellum surtout) at a pretty smart price; and
has been recently clothed in blue morocco. M. Renouard has also some
beautiful copies from the library of <EM>De Thou</EM>, and a partly uncut
<EM>Aldine Theophrastus</EM> of 1497, which belonged to Henry the Second
and Diane de Poictiers; as well as a completely uncut copy of the first
<EM>Aldine Aristotle</EM>.<A name="fnref_137"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_137">137</A> Few men probably have been luckier in obtaining several
of their choice articles; and the little anecdotes which he related to me,
are such as I make no doubt will appear in the projected catalogue
raisonné of his library. He is just now briskly engaged in the pursuit of
<EM>uncut Elzevirs</EM> ... and coming to breakfast with me, the other
morning, he must needs pick up a beautiful copy of this kind, in two small
volumes, neatly half bound, (of which I have forgotten the title,) and of
which he had been for some time in the pursuit. M. Renouard also took
occasion to tell me that, in his way to my chambers, he had sold, or
subscribed, of a forthcoming work to be published by him--just <EM>nine
hundred and ninety-nine copies!</EM> Of course, after such a
<EM>trouvaille</EM> and such a subscription, he relished his breakfast
exceedingly. He is a man of quick movements, of acute perceptions, of
unremitting ardour and activity of mind and body--constantly engaged in
his business, managing a very extensive correspondence, and personally
known to the most distinguished Collectors of Italy. Like his neighbours,
he has his country-house, or rather farm, in Picardy<A name=
"fnref_138"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_138">138</A> whither he
retires, occasionally to view the condition and growing strength of that
species of animal, from the backs of which his beloved Aldus of old,
obtained the <EM>matériel</EM> for his vellum copies. But it is time to
wish M. Renouard a good morning, and to take you with me to his
neighbour--</P>

<P>MONS. BRUNET, THE YOUNGER. This distinguished bibliographer, rather
than bookseller, lives hard by--in the <EM>Rue Gît-Le-Coeur</EM>. He lives
with his father, who superintends the business of the shop. The Rue
Gît-Le-Coeur is a sorry street--very diminutive, and a sort of cropt
copy--to what it should have been, or what it might have been. However,
there lives JACQ. CH. BRUNET, FILS: a writer, who will be known to the
latest times in the bibliographical world. He will be also thanked as well
as known; for his <EM>Manuel du Libraire</EM> is a performance of
incomparable utility to all classes of readers and collectors. You mount
up one pair of stairs:--the way is gloomy, and might well lead to a
chamber in the monastery of La Trappe. You then read an incription, which
tells you that "in turning the button you pull the bell." The bell sounds,
and <EM>Mons. Brunet, Pere</EM>, receives you--with, or without, a silken
cap upon his head. He sits in a small room, sufficiently well filled with
books. "Is the Son at home?" "Open that door, Sir, you will find him in
the next room." The door is immediately opened--and there sits the son,
surrounded by, and almost imprisoned in, papers and books. His pen is in
his hand: his spectacles are upon his nose: and he is transcribing or
re-casting some precious little bit of bibliographical intelligence;
while, on looking up and receiving you, he seems to be "full of the
labouring God!" In short, he is just now deeply and unintermittingly
engaged in a new and <EM>third</EM> edition of his <EM>Manuel</EM>.<A
name="fnref_139"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_139">139</A> The shelves
of his room almost groan beneath the weight of those writers from whom he
gathers his principal materials. "Vous voilà, Mons. Brunet, bien occupé!;"
"Oui, Monsieur, cela me fait autant de plaisir que de peine."</P>

<P>This is a very picture of the man.... "The labour we delight in physics
pain,"--said Lady Macbeth of old; and of a most extraordinary kind must
the labour of Mons. Brunet be considered, when the pleasure in the
prosecution of it balances the pain. We talked much and variously at our
first interview: having previously interchanged many civilities by letter,
and myself having been benefitted by such correspondence, in the
possession of a <EM>large paper</EM> copy of his first edition--of which
he was pleased to make me a present, and of which only twenty copies were
struck off. I told him that I had given Charles Lewis a carte blanche for
its binding, and that I would back <EM>his</EM> skill--the result of such
an order--against any binding at that time visible in any quarter of
Paris! Mons. B. could not, in his heart, have considered any other binding
superior.</P>

<P>He told me, somewhat to my astonishment, and much to my gratification,
that, of the first edition of his <EM>Manuel</EM>, he had printed and sold
<EM>two thousand</EM> copies. This could never have been done in our
country: because, doubting whether it would have been so accurately
printed, it could never have been published, in the same elegant manner,
for the same price. The charges of our printers would have been at least
double. In the typographical execution of it, M. Crapelet has almost
outdone himself. Reverting to the author, I must honestly declare that he
has well merited all he has gained, and will well merit all the gains
which are in store for him. His application is severe, constant, and of
long continuance. He discards all ornament,<A name="fnref_140"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_140">140</A> whether graphic or literary. He is
never therefore digressive; having only a simple tale to tell, and that
tale being almost always <EM>well</EM> and <EM>truly</EM> told.<A name=
"fnref_141"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_141">141</A> In his opinions,
he is firm and rational, and sometimes a little pugnacious in the
upholding of them. But he loves only to breathe in a bibliographical
element, and is never happier than when he has detected some error, or
acquired some new information; especially if it relate to an <EM>Editio
Princeps</EM>.<A name="fnref_142"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_142">142</A> There is also something very naïf and characteristic in
his manner and conversation. He copies no one; and may be said to be a
citizen of the world. In short, he has as little <EM>nationality</EM> in
his opinions and conversation, as any Frenchman with whom I have yet
conversed.</P>

<P>Thus much for the leading booksellers of Paris on the south side of the
Seine: or, indeed, I may say in the whole city. But, because the south is
a warm and genial aspect in the bringing forth of all species of
productions, it does not necessarily follow that ... there should be
<EM>no</EM> bibliopolistic vegetation on the <EM>north</EM> side of the
Seine. Prepare therefore to be introduced to MONS. CHARDIN, in the <EM>Rue
St. Anne</EM>, no. 19; running nearly at right angles with the <EM>Rue St.
Honoré</EM>, not far from the <EM>Eglise St. Roq.</EM> M. Chardin is the
last surviving remains of the OLD SCHOOL of booksellers in Paris; and as I
love antiquities of almost all kinds, I love to have a little occasional
gossip with M. Chardin. A finer old man, with a more characteristic
physiognomy, hath not appeared in France from the time of Gering
downwards. M. Chardin is above the mean height; is usually attired in a
rocquelaure; and his fine flowing grey locks are usually surmounted by a
small black silk cap. His countenance is penetrating, but mild: and he has
a certain air of the "Old School" about him, which is always, to my
old-fashioned taste, interesting and pleasing.</P>

<P>In his youth he must have been handsome, and his complexion is yet
delicate. But good old M. Chardin is an oddity in his way. He physics
"according to the book"--that is, according to the Almanack; although I
should think he had scarcely one spare ounce of blood in his veins.
Phlebotomy is his "dear delight." He is always complaining, and yet
expects to be always free from complaint. But Madame will have it so, and
Monsieur is consenting. He lives on the floor just above the entresol, and
his two or three small apartments are gaily furnished with books. The
interior is very interesting; for his chief treasures are locked up within
glazed cabinets, which display many a rich and rare article. These
cabinets are beautifully ornamented: and I do assure you that it is but
justice to their owner to say, that they contain many an article which
does credit to his taste.</P>

<P>This taste consists principally in a love of ornamented MSS. and
printed books UPON VELLUM, in general very richly bound.<A name=
"fnref_143"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_143">143</A> It is scarcely
seven years ago since M. Chardin published an octavo catalogue, of nearly
two hundred pages, of MSS. and printed books ... all upon vellum. He has
been long noted for rarities of this kind. "Il n'y a que des livres rares"
is his constant exclamation--as you open his glazed doors, and stretch
forth your hand to take down his treasures. He is the EDWARDS of France,
but upon a smaller scale of action. Nor does he push his <EM>wares</EM>,
although he does his <EM>prices</EM>. You may buy or not, but you must
<EM>pay</EM> for what you <EM>do</EM> buy. There is another oddity about
this courteous and venerable bibliopolist. He has a great passion for
making his <EM>Alduses</EM> perfect by means of <EM>manuscript</EM>; and I
must say, that, supposing this plan to be a good one, he has carried it
into execution in a surprisingly perfect manner: for you can scarcely, by
candle-light, detect the difference between what is printed and what is
executed with a pen. I think it was the whole of the <EM>Scholia</EM>
attached to the Aldine <EM>Discorides</EM>, in folio, and a great number
of leaves in the <EM>Grammatical Institutes of Urbanus</EM>, of 1497, 4to.
with several other smaller volumes, which I saw thus rendered perfect: How
any scribe can be sufficiently paid for such toil, is to me inconceivable:
and how it can answer the purpose of any bookseller so to complete his
copies, is also equally unaccountable: for be it known, that good M.
Chardin leaves <EM>you</EM> to make the <EM>discovery</EM> of the MS.
portion; and when you <EM>have</EM> made it,--he innocently
subjoins--"Oui, Monsieur, n'est il pas beau?" In a sort of passage,
between his principal shew-room and his bed room, is contained a very
large collection of tracts and printed volumes relating to the FAIR SEX:
being, in fact, nothing less than a prodigious heap of publications "FOR
and AGAINST" the ladies. M. Chardin will not separate them--adding that
the "bane and antidote must always go together."</P>

<P>This singular character is also vehemently attached to antiquarian
<EM>nick-knackery</EM>. Old china, old drawings, old paintings, old
carvings, and old relics--of whatever kind--are surveyed by him with a
curious eye, and purchased with a well-laden purse. He never speaks of
GOUJIN but in raptures. We made an exchange the other day. M. Chardin hath
no small variety of walking canes. He visited me at the Hôtel one morning,
leaning upon a fine dark bamboo-stick, which was <EM>headed</EM> by an
elaborately carved piece of ivory--the performance of the said Goujon. It
consisted of a recumbent female, (with a large flapped hat on) of which
the head was supported by a shield of coat armour.<A name=
"fnref_144"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_144">144</A> We struck a
bargain in five minutes. He presented me the <EM>stick</EM>, on condition
of my presenting him with a choice copy of the <EM>Ædes Althorpianæ</EM>.
We parted well satisfied with each other; but I suspect that the purchase
of about four-score pounds worth of books, added much to the satisfaction
on his part. Like all his brethren of the same craft, M. Chardin disports
himself on Saturdays and Sundays at his little "ferme ornée," within some
four miles of Paris--having, as he gaily told me "nothing now to do but to
make poesies for the fair sex."<A name="fnref_145"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_145">145</A></P>

<P>With Chardin I close my bibliopolistic narrative; not meaning thereby
to throw other booksellers into the least degree of shade, but simply to
transmit to you an account of such as I have seen and have transacted
business with. And now, prepare for some account of PRINTERS ... or rather
of <EM>three presses</EM> only,--certainly the most distinguished in
Paris. I mean those of the DIDOT and that of M. CRAPELET. The name of
Didot will last as long as learning and taste shall last in any quarter of
the globe: nor am I sure, after all, that what <EM>Bodoni, Bensley</EM>,
and <EM>Bulmer</EM> have done, collectively, has redounded <EM>more</EM>
to the credit of their countries than what Didot has achieved for France.
In ancient classical literature, however, Bodoni has a right to claim an
exception and a superiority. The elder, <EM>Pierre Didot</EM>, is Printer
to his Majesty. But when Pierre Didot l'ainé chose to adopt his
<EM>own</EM> fount of letter--how exquisitely does his skill appear in the
folio <EM>Virgil</EM> of 1798, and yet more, perhaps, in the folio Horace
of 1799!? These are books which never have been, and never <EM>can</EM>
be, eclipsed. Yet I own that the Horace, from the enchanting vignettes of
<EM>Percier</EM>, engraved by Girardais, is to my taste the preferable
volume.<A name="fnref_146"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_146">146</A></P>

<P>FIRMIN DIDOT now manages the press in the <EM>Rué Jacob;</EM> and if he
had never executed any thing but the <EM>Lusiad</EM> of <EM>Camoens</EM>,
his name would be worthy to go down to posterity by the side of that of
his uncle. The number of books printed and published by the Didots is
almost incredible; especially of publications in the Latin and French
languages. Of course I include the <EM>Stereotype</EM> productions: which
are very neat and very commodious--but perhaps the page has rather too
dazzling an effect. I paid a visit the other day to the office of Firmin
Didot; who is a letter founder "as well as a printer.<A name=
"fnref_147"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_147">147</A> To a question
which I asked the nephew, (I think) respecting the number of copies and
sizes, of the famous <EM>Lusiad</EM> just mentioned, he answered, that
there were only <EM>two hundred</EM> copies, and those only of <EM>one
size</EM>. Let that suffice to comfort those who are in terror of having
the small paper, and to silence such as try to depreciate the value of the
book, from the supposed additional number of copies struck off.</P>

<P>I wished to know the costs and charges of <EM>printing</EM>,
&amp;c.--from which the comparative price of labour in the two countries
might be estimated. M. Didot told me that the entire charges for printing,
and pulling, one thousand copies of a full octavo size volume--containing
thirty lines in a page, in a middle-size-letter--including <EM>every
thing</EM> but <EM>paper</EM>--was thirty-five francs per sheet. I am
persuaded that such a thing could not be done at home under very little
short of double the price:--whether it be that our printers, including the
most respectable, are absolutely more extravagant in their charges, or
that the wages of the compositors are double those which are given in
France.</P>

<P>After Didot, comes CRAPELET--in business, skill, and celebrity. He is
himself a very pleasant, unaffected man; scarcely thirty-six; and likely,
in consequence, to become the richest printer in Paris. I have visited him
frequently, and dined with him once--when he was pleased to invite some
agreeable, well-informed, and gentlemanly guests to meet me. Among them
was a M. REY, who has written "<EM>Essais Historiques et Critiques sur
Richard III. Roi d'Angleterre</EM>," just printed in a handsome octavo
volume by our Host. Our conversation, upon the whole; was mixed;
agreeable, and instructive. Madame Crapelet, who is at this moment (as I
should conjecture) perhaps pretty equally divided between her twenty-fifth
and twenty-sixth year, and who may be classed among the prettier ladies of
Paris, did the honours of the fête in a very agreeable manner: nor can it
be a matter of surprise that the choicest Chambertin and Champagne
sparkled upon the table of <EM>one</EM>--who, during the libations of his
guests; had the tympans and friskets of <EM>twenty-two Presses</EM> in
full play!<A name="fnref_148"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_148">148</A>
We retired, after dinner, into a spacious drawing room to coffee and
liqueurs: and anon, to a further room, wherein was a BOOK-CASE filled by
some of the choicest specimens of the press of its owner, as well as of
other celebrated printers. I have forgotten what we took down or what we
especially admired: but, to a question respecting the <EM>present</EM>
state of business, as connected with <EM>literature</EM> and
<EM>printing</EM>, at Paris, M. Crapelet replied (as indeed, if I remember
rightly, M. Didot did also) that "matters never went on better." Reprints
even of old authors were in agitation: and two editions of
<EM>Montaigne</EM> were at that moment going on in his own house. I
complimented M. Crapelet--and with equal sincerity and justice--upon the
typographical execution of M. Brunet's <EM>Manuel du Libraire</EM>. No
printer in our own country, could have executed it more perfectly. "What
might have been the charge per sheet?" My host received the compliment
very soberly and properly; and gave me a general item about the expense of
printing and paper, &amp;c., which really surprised me; and returned it
with a warm eulogy upon the paper and press-work of a recent publication
from the <EM>Shakspeare press</EM>--which, said he, "I despair of
excelling." "And then (added he), your prettily executed vignettes, and
larger prints! In France this branch of the art is absolutely not
understood<A name="fnref_149"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_149">149</A>--and besides, we cannot publish books at <EM>your</EM>
prices!"</P>

<P>We must now bid adieu to the types of M. Crapelet below stairs, and to
his "good cheer" above; and with him take our leave of Parisian
booksellers and printers.<A name="fnref_150"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_150">150</A> What then remains, in the book way, worthy of especial
notice? Do you ask this question? I will answer it in a
trice--BOOK-BINDING. Yes ... some few hours of my residence in this
metropolis have been devoted to an examination of this <EM>seductive</EM>
branch of book commerce. And yet I have not seen--nor am I likely to
see--one single binder: either <EM>Thouvenin, or Simier, or Braidel, or
Lesné</EM>. I am not sure whether Courteval, or either of the Bozérians,
be living: but their <EM>handy works</EM> live and are lauded in every
quarter of Paris.</P>

<P>The restorer, or the Father, (if you prefer this latter appellative) of
modern Book-binding in France, was the Elder Bozérian: of whose
productions the book-amateurs of Paris are enthusiastically fond. Bozérian
undoubtedly had his merits;<A name="fnref_151"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_151">151</A> but he was fond of gilt tooling to excess. His ornaments
are too minute and too profuse; and moreover, occasionally, very
unskilfully worked. His choice of morocco is not always to my taste; while
his joints are neither carefully measured, nor do they play easily; and
his linings are often gaudy to excess. He is however hailed as the
legitimate restorer of that taste in binding, which delighted the
purchasers in the Augustan age of book-collecting. One merit must not be
denied him: his boards are usually square, and well measured. His volumes
open well, and are beaten ... too unmercifully. It is the reigning error
of French binders. They think they can never beat a book sufficiently.
They exercise a tyranny over the leaves, as bad as that of eastern despots
over their prostrate slaves. Let them look a little into the bindings of
those volumes before described by me, in the lower regions of the Royal
Library<A name="fnref_152"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_152">152</A>--and hence learn, that, to hear the leases crackle as
they are turned over, produces <EM>nearly</EM> as much comfort to the
thorough-bred collector, as does the prattling of the first infant to the
doating parent.</P>

<P>THOUVENIN<A name="fnref_153"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_153">153</A> and SIMIER are now the morning and evening stars in the
bibliopegistic hemisphere. Of these, Thouvenin makes a higher circle in
the heavens; but Simier shines with no very despicable lustre. Their work
is good, substantial, and pretty nearly in the same taste. The folio
Psalter of 1502, (I think) in the Royal Library, is considered to be the
<EM>ne plus ultra</EM> of modern book-binding at Paris; and, if I mistake
not, Thouvenin is the artist in whose charcoal furnace, the tools, which
produced this <EM>êchantillon</EM>, were heated. I have no hesitation in
saying, that, considered as an extraordinary specimen of art, it is a
failure. The ornaments are common place; the lining is decidedly bad; and
there is a clumsiness of finish throughout the whole. The head-bands--as
indeed are those of Bozérian--are clumsily managed: and I may say that it
exhibits a manifest inferiority even to the productions of Mackinlay,
Hering, Clarke, and Fairbairn. Indeed either of these artists would
greatly eclipse it. I learn that Thouvenin keeps books in his possession
as long as does a <EM>certain</EM> binder with us--- who just now shall be
nameless. Of course Charles Lewis would smile complacently if you talked
to <EM>him</EM> about rivalling such a performance!<A name=
"fnref_154"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_154">154</A></P>

<P>There is a book-binder of the name of LESNÉ--just now occupied, as I
learn, in writing a poem upon his Art<A name="fnref_155"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_155">155</A>--who is also talked of as an artist of
respectable skill. They say, however, that he <EM>writes</EM> better than
he <EM>binds</EM>. So much the worse for his little ones, if he be
married. Indeed several very sensible and impartial collectors, with whom
I have discoursed, also seem to think that the art of book-binding in
France is just now, if not retrograding, at least stationary--and
apparently incapable of being carried to a higher pitch of excellence. I
doubt this very much. They can do what they have done before. And no such
great conjuration is required in going even far beyond it. Let Thouvenin
and Simier, and even the <EM>Poet</EM> himself, examine carefully the
choice of tools, and manner of gilding, used by our more celebrated
binders, and they need not despair of rivalling them. Above all, let them
look well to the management of the backs of their books, and especially to
the headbands. The latter are in general heavy and inelegant. Let them
also avoid too much choking and beating, (I use technical words--- which
you understand as well as any French or English bookbinder) and especially
to be square, even, and delicate in the bands; and the "Saturnia regna" of
book-binding in France may speedily return.</P>

<P>MEN OF LETTERS. DOM BRIAL. THE ABBÉ BÉTENCOURT. MESSRS. GAIL, MILLIN,
AND LANGÈS. A ROXBURGHE BANQUET.</P>

<P><EM>Paris, June 20, 1818.</EM></P>

<P>MY DEAR FRIEND,</P>

<P>We have had of late the hottest weather in the memory of the oldest
Parisian: but we have also had a few flying thunder showers, which have
helped to cool the air, and to refresh both the earth and its inhabitants.
In consequence, I have made more frequent visits; and have followed up my
morning occupations among BOOKS, by the evening society of those who are
so capable, from their talents, of adding successfully to their number.
Among the most eminent, as well as most venerable of historical
antiquaries, is the celebrated Dom BRIAL, an ex-Benedictin. He lives in
the <EM>Rue Servandoni</EM>, on the second-floor, in the very bosom, as it
were, of his library, and of city solitude. My first visit to him, about
three weeks ago, was fortified by an introductory letter from our friend *
* *. The old gentleman (for he is about seventy four) was busily occupied
at his dinner--about one o'clock; and wearing a silk night cap, and
habited en rocquelaure, had his back turned as his servant announced me.
He is very deaf; but on receiving the letter, and recognising the
hand-writing of our friend, he made me heartily welcome, and begged that I
would partake of his humble fare. This I declined; begging, on the other
hand that he would pursue his present occupation, and allow me to examine
his library. "With the greatest pleasure (replied he); but you will find
it a very common-place one."</P>

<P>His books occupy each of the four rooms which form the suite of his
dwelling. Of course I include the bed room. They are admirably selected:
chiefly historical, and including a very considerable number in the
ecclesiastical department. He has all the historians relating to our own
country. In short, it is with tools like these, and from original MSS.
lent him from the Royal Library--which his official situation
authorizes--- that he carries on the herculean labour of the <EM>Recueil
des Historiens des Gaules, &amp;c.</EM> commenced by BOUQUET and other
editors, and of which he shewed me a great portion of the XVIIth
volume--as well as the commencement of the XVIIIth--already printed.
Providence may be graciously pleased to prolong the life of this learned
and excellent old man till the <EM>latter</EM> volume be completed; but
<EM>beyond</EM> that period, it is hardly reasonable or desirable to wish
it; for if he die, he will then have been gathered to his fathers in a
good old age.<A name="fnref_156"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_156">156</A> But the labours of Dom Brial are not confined to the
"Recueil," just mentioned. They shine conspicuous in the "<EM>Histoire
Littéraire de la France</EM>," of which fifteen goodly quarto volumes are
already printed; and they may be also traced in the famous work entitled
<EM>L'Art de, Verifier les Dates</EM>, in three large folio volumes,
published in 1783, &amp;c. "Quand il est mort, il n'a point son élevè"<A
name="fnref_157"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_157">157</A>--says his old
and intimate friend the ABBÉ BÉTENCOURT; an observation, which, when I
heard it, filled me with mingled regret and surprise--for why is this
valuable, and most <EM>patriotic</EM> of all departments of literature,
neglected <EM>abroad</EM> as well as <EM>at home</EM>? It is worth all the
<EM>digamma</EM> disquisitions in the world; and France, as well as Italy,
was once rich in historical Literati.</P>

<P>Dom Brial is very little above the mean height. He stoops somewhat from
age; but, considering his years, and incessantly sedentary labours, it is
rather marvellous that he does not exhibit more striking proofs of
infirmity. His voice is full and strong; his memory is yet retentive, and
his judgment sound. His hand-writing is extremely firm and legible. No man
ever lived, or ever will, or can live, more completely devoted to his
labours. They are his meat and drink--as much as his "bouilli et petites
poies:"--of which I saw him partaking on repeated visits. Occupied from
morning till night in the prosecution of his studies--in a quarter of
Paris extremely secluded--he appears to be almost unconscious of passing
occurrences without;<A name="fnref_158"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_158">158</A> except it be of the sittings of the <EM>Institute</EM>,
which he constantly attends, on Fridays, as one of the Secretaries. I have
twice dined with him; and, each time, in company with the Abbé Bétencourt,
his brother Secretary at the Institute; and his old, long-tried, and most
intimate friend.</P>

<P>The Abbé BÉTENCOURT was not unknown to me during his late residence in
England, as an Emigré: but he is still-better known to our common friend *
* *, who gave me the letter of introduction to Dom Brial. That mutual
knowledge brought us quickly together, and made us as quickly intimate.
The Abbé is above the middle height; wears his own grey hair; has an
expressive countenance, talks much; and well, and at times drolly. Yet his
wit or mirth is well attempered to his years. His manner of
<EM>rallying</EM> his venerable friend is very amusing; for Dom Brial,
from his deafness, (like most deaf men) drops at times into silence and
abstraction. On each of my dinner-visits, it was difficult to say which
was the hotter day. But Dom Brial's residence, at the hour of dinner,
(which was four--for my own accommodation) happened luckily to be in the
<EM>shade</EM>. We sat down, three, to a small circular table, (in the
further or fourth room) on the tiled floor of which was some very ancient
wine, within the immediate grasp of the right hand of the host. An elderly
female servant attended in the neighbouring room. The dinner was equally
simple, relishing, and abundant; and the virtues of the "old wine" were
quickly put into circulation by the Benedictin founder of the feast.</P>

<P>At six we rose from table, and walked in the Luxembourg gardens, hard
by. The air had become somewhat cooler. The sun was partially concealed by
thin, speckled clouds: a gentle wind was rising; and the fragrance of
innumerable flowers, from terraces crowded with rose-trees, was altogether
so genial and refreshing, that my venerable companions--between whom I
walked arm in arm--declared that "they hardly knew when the gardens had
smelt so sweetly." We went straight onward--towards the
<EM>Observatoire</EM>, the residence of the Astronomer Royal. In our way
thither we could not avoid crossing the <EM>Rue d' Enfer</EM>, where
Marshal Ney was shot. The spot, which had been stained with his blood, was
at this moment covered by skittles, and groups of stout lads were enjoying
themselves in all directions. It should seem that nothing but youthful
sports and pastimes had ever prevailed there: so insensibly do succeeding
occupations wear away all traces of the past. I paused for half a minute,
casting a thoughtful eye towards the spot. The Abbé Bétencourt moralised
aloud, and Dom Brial seemed inwardly to meditate. We now reached the
Observatory. The Sub-Principal was at home, and was overjoyed to receive
his venerable visitors. He was a fellow-townsman of Dom Brial, and we were
shewn every thing deserving of notice. It was nearly night-fall, when, on
reaching the Rue Servandoni, I wished my amiable companions adieu, till we
met again.</P>

<P>I have before mentioned the name of M. GAIL. Let me devote a little
more time and attention to him. He is, as you have been also previously
told, the curator of the Greek and Latin MSS. in the Royal Library, and a
Greek Professor in the Collège Royale. There is no man, at all alive to a
generous and kind feeling, who can deny M. Gail the merit of a frank,
benevolent, and hearty disposition. His Greek and Latin studies, for the
last thirty-five years, have neither given a severe bias to his judgment,
nor repressed the ebullitions of an ardent and active imagination. His
heart is yet all warmth and kindness. His fulfilment of the duties of his
chair has been exemplary and beneficial; and it is impossible for the most
zealous and grateful of her sons, to have the prosperity of the Collège
Royale more constantly in view, than my friend I.B. Gail has that of the
University of Paris. His labours, as a scholar, have been rather useful
than critical. He has edited <EM>Anacreon</EM> more than once: and to the
duodecimo edition of 1794, is prefixed a small
portrait--medallion-wise--of the editor; which, from the costume of dress
and juvenility of expression, does not much remind me of the Editor as he
now is. M. Gail's great scholastic work is his Greek, Latin, and French,
editions of <EM>Xenophon</EM> and <EM>Thucydides</EM>, in twenty-four
quarto volumes; but in the execution of this performance he suffered
himself to be rather led astray by the attractions of the
<EM>Bibliomania</EM>. In other words, he chose to indulge in membranaceous
propensities; and nothing would serve M. Gail's turn but he must have a
unique COPY UPON VELLUM! in a quarto form.<A name="fnref_159"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_159">159</A> Twenty four quarto volumes upon
vellum!.. enough to chill the ardour and drain the purse of the most
resolute and opulent publisher.</P>

<P>When I dined with the Editor, the other day, I was shewn these superb
volumes with all due form and solemnity: and I must say that they do very
great credit to the press of the Elder Didot. Yet I fear that it will be a
long time before the worthy M. Gail is remunerated for his enterprising
and speculative spirit. In all the duties attached to his situation in the
Royal Library, this worthy character is equally correct and commendable.
He is never so fully occupied with old Greek and Latin MSS., but that he
will immediately attend to your wants; and, as much as depends upon
himself, will satisfy them most completely. Anacreon has left behind some
little deposit of good humour and urbanity, which has continued to nourish
the heart of his Translator; for M. Gail is yet jocose, and mirth-loving;
fond of a lively repartee, whether in conversation or in writing. He may
count some sixty-two years.</P>

<P>But it is high time to introduce you to another of these "Confrères" at
the Bibliothèque du Roi; of whom indeed, hitherto, I have made but a
slight mention. You will readily guess that this must be the well-known
AUBIN LOUIS MILLIN--the Head of the department of Antiquities; or the
principal <EM>Archaeologist</EM> of the establishment. My friend Mr.
Dawson Turner having furnished me with introductory credentials, I called
upon M. Millin within twenty-four hours of my arrival at Paris. In
consequence, from that time to this, I have had frequent intercourse with
him. Indeed I am willing to hope that our acquaintance has well nigh
mellowed into friendship. He is a short, spare, man; with a countenance
lighted up by intelligence rather than moulded by beauty. But he is
evidently just now (and indeed, as I learn, has been for some time past)
labouring under severe indisposition. He is the thorough Frenchman both in
figure and manners: light, cheerful, active, diligent, and exceedingly
good natured and communicative. His apartments are admirably furnished:
and his LIBRARY does him infinite honour--considering the limited means by
which it has been got together. His abode is the constant resort of
foreigners, from all countries, and of all denominations; and the library
is the common property of his friends, and even of strangers--when they
are well recommended to him.</P>

<P>Millin has been a great traveller; but, if the reports which have
reached me prove true, his second voyage to Italy, recently accomplished,
have sown the seeds of incurable disease in his constitution. Indeed: when
I look at him, at times, I fancy that I discover <EM>that</EM> in his
countenance ... which I wish were not so palpable ... to my observation.
His collection of drawings, of fac-similes of all descriptions--of prints
and of atlasses--is immense. They are freely laid open to the inspection
of any curious observer: and I have already told you how heartily M.
Millin begged that Mr. Lewis would consider his house as his
<EM>home</EM>--for the prosecution of his drawings from the illuminated
MSS. in the Royal Library, when the regular time of attendance in that
place was closed. The other day, we had a superb déjeuné à la fourchette
at M. Millin's--about three o'clock. It was attended by two Marchionesses,
of the <EM>bas bleu</EM> order; and by the whole corps of the confrères
bibliographiques of the Royal Library. Several other literary
<EM>distingués</EM> were of the party: and we sat down, a very agreeable
mélange, both to gossip and to eat and drink. M. Langlès was all animation
and all intelligence; and M. Van Praet seemed for a time to have forgotten
VELLUM ARISTOTLES and VIRGILS in alternate libations of champagne and
noyeau. Meanwhile, the worthy Gail, by his playful sallies and repartees,
afforded a striking contrast to the balanced attitude and grave remarks of
the respectable Caperonnier, the senior Librarian. Poor Millin himself had
no appetite, but picked a little here and there. We sat down about
fourteen; rose at six--to coffee and conversazione; and retired shortly
after: some to the theatre, and others to their country houses. This is
pretty nearly a correct picture of the bettermost society of Paris at this
time of the year.</P>

<P>In regard to the literary reputation of MILLIN, I well know that, in
England, it is rather the fashion to sneer at him; but this sneer may
proceed as often from ignorance, as from superiority of information. The
truth is, M. Millin does <EM>too much</EM> to do every thing
<EM>well</EM>. At one moment, he is busied with a dyptych: at another, he
is examining a coin or a medal: during the third, he is lost in admiration
over a drawing of a tomb or statue:--his attendant enters with a
proof-sheet to engage his fourth moment--and so it goes on--from sunrise
to sunset; with pen in hand, or blank or printed paper before him, he is
constantly occupied in the pursuit of some archaeological enquiry or
other. THIS praise, however--and no mean or unperishable praise it
is--most indisputably belongs to him. He was almost the ONLY ONE in
France; who, during the reign of terror, bloodshed, and
despotism--cherished and kept alive a taste for NATIONAL ANTIQUITIES. But
for <EM>his</EM> perseverance, and the artists employed by <EM>him</EM>,
we should not now have had those <EM>graphic</EM> representations of many
buildings, and relics of art, which have since perished irretrievably.
Another praise also belongs to him; of no very insignificant description.
He is among the most obliging and communicative of literary Parisians; and
does not suffer his good nature to be soured, or his activity to abate,
from the influence of <EM>national</EM> prejudice. He has a large
acquaintance among foreigners; and I really think that he loves the
English next best to his own countrymen. But whoever applies to him with
civility, is sure to be as civilly received. So much for MILLIN.<A name=
"fnref_160"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_160">160</A></P>

<P>This group of literary <EM>whole lengths</EM> would however be
imperfect without the introduction of Monsieur LANGLÈS. The <EM>forte</EM>
of M. Langlès consists in his cultivation of, and enthusiastic ardor for,
<EM>oriental literature</EM>. He presides, in fact, over the Persian,
Arabic, and other Oriental MSS. and he performs the duties of his office,
as a public librarian, with equal punctuality and credit. He has also
published much upon the languages of the East, but is considered less
profound than DE SACY: although both his conversation and his library
attest his predilection for his particular studies. M. Langlès is eclipsed
by no one for that "gaieté de coeur" which, when joined with good manners
and honourable principles, renders a well-bred Frenchman an exceedingly
desirable companion. He loves also the arts; as well of sculpture as of
painting and of engraving. His further room affords unquestionable
evidence of his attachment to <EM>English Prints</EM>. Wilson, West, and
Wilkie--from the burins of Woollett, Raimbach, and Burnet--struck my eye
very forcibly and pleasingly. M. Langlès admires and speaks our language.
"Your charming Wilkie (says he) pleases me more and more. Why does he not
visit us? He will at least find here some <EM>good proofs</EM> of my
respect for his talents." Of course he could not mean to pun. I was then
told to admire his impression of Woollett's <EM>Battle of La Hogue</EM>;
and indeed I must allow that it is one of the very best which I have seen.
He who possesses <EM>that</EM>, need not distress himself about any of the
impressions of the <EM>Death of Wolfe</EM>; which is also in the
collection of Langlès.</P>

<P>His library is probably less extensive than Millin's; but it is not
less choice and valuable. His collection of books (in which are a great
number of our best Voyages and Travels) relating to Asia--and particularly
his philological volumes, as connected with the different languages of
that country, cannot be too much commended. I saw Sir John Malcolm's
<EM>History of Persia</EM> lying upon his table. "How do you like that
work, M. Langlès?" "Sir (replied he) I more than like it--I love it:
because I love the author." In fact, I knew that Sir John and he were well
acquainted with each other, and I believe that the copy in question bore
the distinctive mark of being "ex dono auctoris." I have had a good deal
of interesting conversation with M. Langlès about the history of books
during the Revolution; or rather about that of the ROYAL LIBRARY. He told
me he was appointed one of the commissioners to attend to the distribution
of those countless volumes which were piled up in different warehouses, as
the produce of the <EM>ransacked monasteries</EM>. I am not sure, whether,
within the immediate neighbourhood of the Royal Library, he did not say
that there were at least <EM>half a million of books</EM>. At that time,
every public meeting of Parisians--whatever might be the professed
object--was agitated, and often furious. One of the red-hot demagogues got
up in the assembly, and advised "mangling, maiming, or burning the books:
they were only fit for cartridges, wadding, or fuel: they were replete
with marks of feudalism and royalty--for they had arms or embellishments
on them, which denoted them to belong to Aristocrats." This speech made
some impression: his comrades were for carrying the motion immediately
into execution, by sword and faggot.... But M. Langlès rose ... calm,
collected, and actuated by feelings a little more accordant with the true
spirit of patrotism. "Citizens," said the Orientalist, "we must not do
mischief, in the desire of doing good. Let the books remain where they
are. If you set fire to them, can you say how far the flames shall extend?
Our own great national library, so renowned and celebrated throughout
Europe! may become the prey of the devouring element, and <EM>then</EM>
how will you be reproached by posterity! Again--if you convert them to
<EM>other</EM> purposes of destruction, how can you hope to prevent the
same example from being followed in other places? The madness of the
multitude will make no distinction; and as many pikes and swords may be
carried within the great library, as within the various depositories of
the monastic books. Pause awhile. Respect those collections of books, and
you will both respect yourselves and preserve the great national library.
In due time, we shall make a proper selection from them, and enrich the
book stores of the capital!" So spake M. Langlès; and the Assembly
assented to his contre-projet--luckily for Paris and themselves.<A name=
"fnref_161"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_161">161</A></P>

<P>But nearly all these worthy characters, of whom I have just made
mention, had an opportunity of exhibiting their social qualities, of
whatever description, at a sort of FESTIVAL which I gave the other day
(last Wednesday) in honour of the <STRONG>Roxburghe Club</STRONG>--which
met on that same day, I presume, at the Clarendon Hotel. This Parisian
Roxburghe Banquet went off upon the whole with flying colours. You shall
know as much about it as is likely to interest you. Having secured my
guests, (Messrs. DENON, GAIL, LANGLÈS, VAN PRAET and MILLIN) and fixed
both the place and hour of repast, I endeavoured to dress out a little
bill of fare of a <EM>bibliomaniacal</EM> description--to rival, in its
way, that of <EM>Mons. Grignon</EM>, in the <EM>Rue Neuve des Petits
Champs</EM>, (within two minutes walk of the Royal Library,) where we were
to assemble, at five o'clock. I knew that Millin would put my toasts or
sentiments into good French, and so I took courage against the hour of
meeting. I had secured a ground-floor apartment, looking upon a lawn, with
which it communicated by open doors. The day was unusually hot and
oppressive. After finishing my labours at the Royal Library, I returned to
my hotel, arranged my little matters connected with the by-play of the
festival--dressed--and resorted to Grignon's. Every thing looked well and
auspiciously. Our room was in the shade; and a few lingering breezes
seemed to play beneath the branches of an acacia. The dark green bottles,
of various tapering shapes, were embedded in pails of ice, upon the table:
and napkins and other goodly garniture graced the curiously woven cloth. I
hung up, in the simplicity of my heart--over the seat which I was to
occupy,--the portrait of <EM>John King of France</EM>, which M. Coeuré had
just finished;--not considering that this said John had been beaten and
taken prisoner, at the battle of Poictiers by our Black Prince! Never was
a step more injudicious, or an ornament more unappropriate. However, there
it hung throughout the day. A dinner of the very best description,
exclusively of the wine, was to be served up for <EM>twelve francs</EM> a
head. I make no doubt but the Club paid a <EM>little</EM> more where they
assembled in London!</P>

<P>At length came the hour of dinner, and with the hour the guests. I
requested Brother Van Praet to be deputy chairman; and taking my seat
beneath the unfortunate John King of France, gave the signal for a general
attack--upon whatever was placed before the guests. Monsieur Denon,
however, did not arrive till after the first course. He had been detained
by a visit from the Duke of Bedford. M. Millin sat at my right hand, and
M. Gail at my left. The first course consisted chiefly of fruit, and
slices of anchovy, crossed. A large paper copy of a <EM>melon</EM> cut a
magnificent appearance in the centre; but all this quickly gave way to
fish, flesh, and fowl of a various but substantial description. Poor
Millin had no appetite, and would only carve. He looked particularly ill.
The rest ate, drank, and were merry. The desert was of the very best
quality: and this was succeeded by the introduction of a little of English
fashion and manners. We drank toasts, connected with the object of the
day's festival; and never were a set of guests more disposed to relish
both the wine and the sentiment which accompanied each glass. They even
insisted upon a "three times three" for "Lord Spencer and the Club!" But
if we were merry, we were wise. Shortly after dinner, M. Gail rose, as if
in a moment of inspiration, from his seat--and recited the Latin verses
which are here enclosed.<A name="fnref_162"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_162">162</A> They will at least make you admire the good humour of
thé poet. He afterwards chanted a song: his own literal version of thé
XIXth ode of Anacreon, beginning <!--[Greek: Hê gê melaina pinei]. -->
 '&#951; &#947;&#951; &#956;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#945;
&#960;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#953;. The guests declared that they had never
sat so long at table, or were more happy. I proposed a stroll or a seat
upon the lawn. Chairs and benches were at hand; and we requested that the
coffee might be brought to us out of doors. It was now after sun-set; and
a lurid sky was above our head. Our conversation was desultory as to
topics, but animated as to manner. I had never witnessed M. Van Praet more
alive to social disquisition. We talked of books, of pictures, and of
antiquities ... and I happened, with the same witless simplicity which had
pinned the portrait of King John over my seat at dinner, to mention that
volume, of almost unparalleled rarity, ycleped <EM>the Fables of Pfister,
printed at Bamberg</EM> in 1461:--which they had recently RESTORED to the
Wolfenbuttel Library! It was "more than enough" for the acute feelings of
the devoted head-librarian. M. Van Praet talked with legs and arms, as
well as with tongue, in reply to my observations upon the extraordinary
worth and singular rarity of that singular volume. "Alas, Sir, nothing
pained me more. Truly--"Here a smart flash of lightning came across
us--which illumined our countenances with due effect: for it had been
sometime past almost wholly dark, and we had been talking to each other
without perceiving a feature in our respective faces. M. Langlès joined in
M. Van Praet's lamentation; and the Baron Denon, who (as I learnt) had
been the means of obtaining that identical precious volume, united his
tones of commiseration with those of his brethren.</P>

<P>The lightning now became more frequent, and in larger flashes--but
neither sharp nor very dazzling. Meanwhile the notes of a skilfully
touched harp were heard from one of the windows of a neighbouring house,
with a mingled effect which it was difficult to describe.
<EM>Pfister</EM>, books, busts, and music, now wholly engrossed our
attention--and we were absolutely enveloped in blue lightning. We had
continued our discourse till towards midnight, had not the rain come down
in a manner equally sudden and severe. It was one of the heaviest showers
which I remember to have witnessed. The storm was directly in the centre
of Paris, and over our heads. We retreated precipitately to the deserted
banqueting room; and had a reinforcement of coffee. After such a series of
melting hot weather, I shall not easily forget the refreshing sweetness
emitted from every shrub upon the lawn. About ten o'clock, we thought of
our respective homes.<A name="fnref_163"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_163">163</A> I went into another room to pay the reckoning; liberated
King John from his second confinement; shook hands very heartily with my
guests--and returned to my lodgings by no means out of humour or out of
heart with the day's entertainment. Whether they have been more rational,
or more <EM>economical</EM>, in the celebration of the same festival, AT
HOME, is a point, which I have some curiosity, but no right, to discuss.
Certainly they could not have been happier.</P>

<P>Having come to the conclusion of my account of the ROXBURGHE BANQUET,
and it being just now hard upon the hour of midnight, I must relinquish my
correspondent for my pillow. A good night.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER X.</H3>

<P>THE COLLECTIONS OF DENON, QUINTIN CRAUFURD, AND THE MARQUIS DE
SOMMARIVA.</P>

<P>All the world has heard of the famous DENON, the Egyptian traveller;
and editor of the great work of the <EM>Antiquities of Egypt</EM>,
published in 1802, in two sumptuous folio volumes. As you possess a copy
of the French work,<A name="fnref_164"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_164">164</A> with choice impressions of the plates, I need say
nothing further upon the subject--except that I believe it to be one of
the very finest works of the kind, which has ever appeared ... on the
score of art. But the author has other claims to attention and popularity.
He was an intimate friend--and certainly the confidential adviser--of
Buonaparte, in all public schemes connected with the acquisition of
pictures and statues: and undoubtedly he executed the task confided to him
with <EM>ability</EM>. He was verging oh his sixtieth year, when he
started with his master upon the Egyptian expedition--a proof at least of
energy, as well as of good disposition, in the cause. But Denon has been a
great European traveller: he has had access to private, as well as to
public, cabinets; and has brought home some rich fruits of his enterprise
and taste.</P>

<P>His house, on the <EM>Quai Malaquais</EM>, is the rendezvous of all the
English of any taste--who have respectable letters of introduction; and I
must do him the justice to say, that, never did a man endure the
<EM>inconveniences</EM> which must frequently result from keeping such
open house, with greater adroitness and good humour than does the Baron
Denon. I have sometimes found his principal rooms entirely filled by my
countrymen and countrywomen; and I once, from the purest accident, headed
a party of <EM>twenty-two</EM> ... in which were three British officers,
and more than that number of members of either University. I will fairly
own that, on receiving us, he drew me quietly aside, and observed:--"Mon
ami, quand vous viendrez une autre fois, ne commandez pas, je vous prie,
une armée si nombreuse. Je m'imaginois encore en Egypte." What was still
more perplexing, we found there a party of English as numerous as
ourselves. It was thus, however, that he rebuked my indiscretion.</P>

<P>We had twice exchanged visits and cards before we met. The card of
Denon was worth possessing, from the simple, unaffected modesty which it
evinced. You merely read the word DENON upon it!... The owner of the
collection which I am about to describe, is certainly "un peu passé" as to
years; but he has a cheerful countenance, with the tint of health upon it;
small, gray, sparkling eyes, and teeth both regular and white.<A name=
"fnref_165"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_165">165</A> He is generally
dressed in black, and always as a gentleman. His figure, not above the
middle height, is well formed; and his step is at once light and firm.
There is doubtless a good deal which is very prepossessing in his manners.
As he understands nothing of the English language, he can of course
neither read nor speak it.</P>

<P>It is now time to give you some idea of this curious collection. You
ascend a lofty and commodious stone staircase (not very common in Paris)
and stop at the <EM>first</EM> floor:--another comfort, also very rare in
Paris. This collection is contained in about half a dozen rooms: lofty,
airy, and well furnished. The greater number of these rooms faces the
Seine. The first contains a miscellaneous assemblage of bronze busts, and
pictures of Teniers, Watteau, and of the more modern School of Paris. Of
these, the Watteau is singular, rather than happy, from its size.<A name=
"fnref_166"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_166">166</A> The two Teniers
are light, thin, pictures; sketches of pigs and asses; but they are very
covetable morsels of the artist.<A name="fnref_167"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_167">167</A> In a corner, stands the skeleton of a female mummy
in a glass case, of which the integuments are preserved in a basket. This
is thought to be equally precious and uncommon. M. Denon shews the foot of
the figure (which is mere bone and muscle) with amazing triumph and
satisfaction. He thinks it is as fine as that of the Venus de Medicis, but
there is no accounting for tastes. Among the busts is one of West, of
Neckar, and of Denon himself: which latter I choose here to call
"<EM>Denon the First</EM>." The second room contains a very surprising,
collection of Phoenician, Egyptian, and other oriental curiosities: and in
a corner, to the left, is a set of small drawers, filled with very
interesting medals of eminent characters, of all descriptions, chiefly of
the sixteenth century. Above them is a portrait of the owner of the
collection--which I choose to call "<EM>Denon the Second</EM>." This room
exhibits a very interesting mélange. Over the fire place are some busts;
of which the most remarkable are those of <EM>Petrarch</EM> and
<EM>Voltaire</EM>; the former in bronze, the latter in terra-cotta; each
of the size of life. Voltaire's bust strikes me as being the best
representation of the original extant. It is full of character; a
wonderful mixture of malignity, wit, and genius.<A name="fnref_168"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_168">168</A></P>

<P>The third room is the largest, and the most splendidly hung with
pictures. Of these, the circular little Guercino--a holy family--is, to my
poor judgment, worth the whole.<A name="fnref_169"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_169">169</A> The Rysdael and Both are very second rate. As you
approach the fire-place, your attention is somewhat powerfully directed to
a small bronze whole length figure of Buonaparte--leaning upon a table,
with his right hand holding a compass, and his left resting upon his left
thigh.<A name="fnref_170"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_170">170</A> Some
charts, with a pair of compasses, are upon the table; and I believe this
represents him in his cabin, on his voyage to Egypt. Is there any
representation of him, in the same situation, upon his <EM>return</EM>?
However, it is an admirable piece of workmanship. In this room is also (if
I remember rightly) the original colossal head of the ex-emperor, when a
young man, in white marble, by CANOVA. But I must not omit informing you
that here is also another portrait, in oil, of the owner of the
collection--which, if you please, we will call "<EM>Denon the Third</EM>."
You next enter a narrow, boudoir-shaped apartment, which contains, to my
taste, the most curious and precious morsels of art which the Baron Denon
possesses. They are specimens of the earlier schools of painting,
commencing with what are called <EM>Giottos</EM> and
<EM>Cimabues</EM>--down to a very striking modern picture of a group of
children, by a late French artist, just before the time of our Reynolds.
This latter you would really conceive to have been the production of Sir
Joshua himself. Of the specimens of the earlier schools, I was most struck
with the head of PISANI, the inventor of medals--of the fifteenth
century--painted by <EM>Antonello da Messina</EM>, a pupil of John Van
Eyk. It is full of nature and of character. I could not get away from it.
"Is it possible to obtain a copy of this picture?"--said I to its owner.
"I understand you, (replied Denon) you wish to carry that copy to your own
country. And to have it engraved there?" ... "Most
unquestionably"--resumed I. "It is at your service (he rejoined); Laurent
will copy it admirably." I hardly knew how to thank Mons. Denon
sufficiently.<A name="fnref_171"></A><A class="fnref" href=

</DIV>

<P>There was another head ...but "non omnia possumus omnes." I mean, one
of a female in profile, by MASACCIO. It was full of expression.<A name=
"fnref_172"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_172">172</A> "What, (said its
owner,) must you have an engraving of <EM>that</EM> head also? It is
bespoke; by myself. In short, every thing which you behold in these rooms
(including even your favourite Pisani) will be <EM>lithographised</EM> for
the publication of my own collection." Of course, after this declaration,
I was careful of what I did or said. "But there was yet <EM>one</EM> thing
in this collection--of which, as I saw such a variety, he could not refuse
me a copy." "What might that be?" "A portrait of HIMSELF: from marble,
from oil, or from enamel." "Take your choice: he replied: "faites ce que
vous voulez,"--and it was agreed that M. Laguiche should make a drawing of
the bust, in white marble, (I think the sculptor's name is Bosio) which is
indeed very like him.<A name="fnref_173"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_173">173</A> There is also a large and beautiful enamel of Denon,
full dressed with all his orders, by Augustin; perhaps the most perfect
specimen of that artist which France possesses. It is the work of several
years past, when Denon had more flesh upon his cheek, and more fire in his
eye. We may therefore say that this room contains "<EM>Denon the Fourth,
and Denon the Fifth</EM>!"</P>

<P>In the same room you observe a very complete specimen of a papyrus
inscription; brought from Egypt. Indeed the curiosities brought from that
country (as might naturally be supposed) are numerous and valuable. But my
attention was directed to more <EM>understandable</EM> objects of art.
Opposite to the bust of Denon, is one of his late master, the ex-Emperor,
in bronze: and above this latter, is a small picture, by <EM>Lucas
Cranach</EM>, of a man with a bag of money tempting a young woman: full of
character, and singularly striking. This room--or the one adjoining, I
have forgotten which--contains M. Denon's collection of the prints of MARC
ANTONIO or of REMBRANDT--or of both; a collection, which is said to be
<EM>unequalled</EM>.<A name="fnref_174"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_174">174</A> Whether the former be more precious than the latter, or
whether both be superior to what our British Museum contains of the same
masters, is a point which has not yet been fairly determined. But I asked,
one morning, for a glimpse of the Rembrandts. We were alone; just after we
had breakfasted together. M. Denon commenced by shewing me two different
states of the <EM>Coach Landscape</EM>, and the two <EM>great
Coppinols</EM> with <EM>white grounds</EM>--each varying somewhat!!!
"Enough," cried I--holding up both hands,--"you beat all in England and
all in France!"</P>

<P>From hence you pass into a fourth room, which is M. Denon's
bed-chamber. About the fire-place are numerous little choice bits of the
graphic art. Two small <EM>Watteaus</EM>, in particular, are perfectly
delicious;<A name="fnref_175"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_175">175</A>
as well as a very small <EM>Sebastian Bourdon</EM>; of a holy family. In a
corner, too much darkened, is a fine small portrait of <EM>Parmegiano</EM>
in profile: full of expression--and, to the best of my recollection, never
engraved. These are, I think, the chief bijoux in the bed-room; except
that I might notice some ancient little bronzes, and an enamel or two by
Petitot. You now retrace your steps, and go into a fifth room, which has
many fair good pictures, of a comparatively modern date; and where, if I
mistake not, you observe at least <EM>one</EM> portrait in oil of the
master of the premises. This therefore gives us "<EM>Denon the
Seventh</EM>!" It is here that the master chiefly sits: and he calls it
his workshop. His drawers and port-folios are, I think, filled with prints
and old-drawings: innumerable, and in the estimation of the owner,
invaluable. You yet continue your route into a further room,--somewhat
bereft of furniture, or en dishabille. Here, among other prints, I was
struck with seeing that of <EM>the late Mr. Pitt</EM>; from Edridge's
small whole length. The story attached to it is rather singular. It was
found on board the first naval prize (a frigate) which the French made
during the late war; and the Captain begged Monsieur Denon's acceptance of
it. Here were also, if I remember rightly, prints of Mr. Fox and Lord
Nelson; but, as objects of <EM>art</EM>, I could not help looking with
admiration--approaching to incredulity--upon three or four large prints,
after Rembrandt and Paul Potter, which M. Denon assured me were the
production of <EM>his</EM> burin! I could scarcely believe it. Whatever be
the merits of Denon, as a critical judge of art, ancient or modern, there
is no person, not wholly blinded by prejudice, or soured by national
antipathies, that can deny him great zeal, great talent, and great feeling
... in the several pursuits of art, of which his apartments furnish such
splendid evidence.</P>

<P>But, you may be disposed to add, "has this celebrated man no collection
of Books?--no LIBRARY? At least he must have a <EM>missal</EM> or two?"
'Tis even so, my friend. Library, he has none: for as "one swallow does
not make a summer," so three or four pretty little illuminated volumes do
not constitute a library. However, what he has of this kind, has been
freely exhibited to me; and I here send you a transscript of some notes
taken upon the spot.</P>

<P>I was first shewn a small missal, prettily executed in a gothic type,
of the Italian form, after the models of those of Jenson and Hailbrun. The
calendar has the paintings injured. On the reverse of the last leaf of the
Calendar, we read, in roman capitals, the following impressive annotation:
DEUM TIME, PAUPERES SUSTINE, MEMENTO FINIS. On the reverse of the ensuing
leaf, is a large head of Christ, highly coloured: but with the lower part
of the face disproportionately short: not unlike a figure of a similar
kind, in the Duke of Devonshire's Missal, described on a former
occasion.<A name="fnref_176"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_176">176</A>
The crucifixon, on the next leaf but one, is full of spirit and effect.
Then commence the <EM>Drolleries</EM>: or a series of subjects most
whimsically conceived, but most sweetly touched and finished. You cannot
imagine any thing more perfect of their kind and for their size, than are
the beasts, birds, insects, fruits, and flowers. The vellum harmonises
admirably, from its colour and quality. There are several comparatively
large illuminations: some with very small figures; and two (one of St.
John the Baptist, and the other of Christ mocked) are of great beauty in
respect to force of colour. The initial capitals are executed with equal
attention to taste in composition, and delicacy in colouring. This
diminutive volume is only four inches high, by about two inches and three
quarters wide. It is bound in red velvet, and mounted with silver knobs,
with heads of cherubim upon them. It is fastened by a silver clasp; upon
which is painted, and glazed, a head of Christ--of the time, as I
conceive. M. Denon told me he bought this little gem of a bookseller in
Italy, for 400 francs.</P>

<P>He has another Missal, about half an inch wider and taller, in the
binding of the time, with stamped ornaments. This exhibits flowers,
fruits, and birds, in the margins; touched with great delicacy and truth.
Some of the borders have a gold ground, shaded with brown, upon which the
fruit is richly brought out in relief: others have human figures; and the
border, encircling the temptation of our first Parents, has nothing
superior to it--and is really worth an engraved fac-simile: but not in
<EM>lithography!</EM> It is on the forty-fifth leaf. One of the heads, in
the border, is like that of our Edward VI. The third illuminated ms.
volume, in M. Denon's possession, is probably the most valuable. It is a
quarto, written in the Spanish language, and bearing the date of 1553. The
scription is in red and black letters, alternately. This book contains
several large illuminations, and coloured borders; and I was told, by its
owner, that it was the <EM>very book</EM> upon which the OATHS OF
INITIATION INTO THE SPANISH INQUISITION were administered. Its condition
is most perfect. The first large illumination represents a Saint, with his
scull divided by a sword, and blood streaming copiously from him: a palm,
with three crowns, is in his right hand; a book is in his left: at top we
read "<EM>Exsurge Domine, et judica Causam tuam</EM>." The Saint is
surrounded by a border of fruits and flowers. It is the principal
embellishment in the volume. This book is in its original, black leather,
stamped binding, with knobs and clasps. A marginal note thus remarks:
"<EM>ynoscan obligados asseruier cargome off<SUP>o</SUP>. de ella salbo si
de su voluntad loquisier en servi</EM>."</P>

<P>In my last visit to Denon,<A name="fnref_177"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_177">177</A> I met with ANDRIEU; a name which reflects lustre
upon the Fine Arts. As a medallist, he has no equal, nor perhaps ever had
any, among the French. Our own SIMON enables us to oppose to him a rival
of great and unquestionable talents; but we have slept soundly, both in
the <EM>medallic</EM> and <EM>numismatic</EM> art, since the time of
Cromwell: except that we were shook a little out of our slumbers during
the reigns of Anne and George I. Andrieu has more of the pure Greek
feeling about him, than Simon ever evinced: and prefers executing his
<EM>hair</EM> more in masses than in detail. He is therefore on this head,
a copyist; but he transfuses into the countenance that soul and
intelligence which we delight to contemplate, and which we are prompt to
own, in the countenances upon Greek coins. The series of
<EM>Bonaparte-Medals</EM> are, almost entirely, I believe, the work of his
hand. But <EM>every</EM> head is <EM>safe</EM> with Andrieu. He had just
brought a medal of the present King (Louis XVIII.) to shew Denon. It was
about the size of our half crown, in bronze. The countenance was in
profile:--an admirable, and a very strong resemblance. The reverse was the
equestrian statue of Henri IV., upon the Pont-Neuf.<A name=
"fnref_178"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_178">178</A> Upon the whole,
quite as good, as an effort of <EM>art</EM>, as what has been done for
Bonaparte. The artist had well nigh succeeded in drawing me into a sort of
half temptation to bespeak an impression of the medal <EM>in gold</EM>.
"It was but a trifling sum--some twenty louis, or thereabouts. It would
look so sharp and splendid in gold! and...." "I thank you much Sir,
(replied I) but twenty louis will carry me almost to <EM>Strasbourg</EM>,
whither I am to proceed in about a week or ten days." One thing I must
add, much to his good sense and pure patriotic feeling:--he had been
indirectly solicited to strike some medals, commemorative of the
illustrious achievements of our WELLINGTON: but this he pointedly
declined. "It was not, Sir, for <EM>me</EM> to perpetuate the name of a
man who had humbled the power, and the military glory, of my <EM>own
country</EM>." Such was his remark to me. What is commendable in MUDIE,<A
name="fnref_179"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_179">179</A> would have
been ill-timed, if not disgraceful, in Andrieu.</P>

<P>Come with me, now, to a very different exhibition: to a unique
collection, of its kind: to a collection, not frequently visited: as
little known; but undoubtedly well deserving both of being often visited
and described. It is of the <EM>Collection of Paintings</EM> belonging to
MR. QUINTIN CRAUFURD, living in the <EM>Rue d'Anjou</EM>, no. 21, that I
am about to speak:--the fruits of a long residence (upwards of thirty
years) in France; during the alternate commotions of republicanism and
despotism. A letter of introduction procured me every facility of access
to make repeated examinations of these treasures; and during my
sojournings I fancied myself holding converse alternately with some of the
grandees of the time of Francis I. and Louis XIV.</P>

<P>Such a collection of <EM>French portraits</EM>--almost entirely of
characters who have cut a figure in <EM>history</EM>--is no where else to
be seen in Paris. In my estimation, it is beyond all price.</P>

<P>Facing you, as you enter, stands--firmly upon his legs, and looking you
manfully in the face--- the gallant and faithful <EM>Comte De Brienne,
Grand Master of the Ceremonies to Francis I. and Henry II.</EM> A fine
picture; and quite perfect.<A name="fnref_180"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_180">180</A> To the left, is a charming whole length portrait, by
<EM>Velasquez</EM>: a tender and exquisitely careful specimen of art. Of
other whole lengths, but subordinately executed, you should notice one of
<EM>Christine, Duchesse de Savoie</EM>, daughter of Henry II. and
Catherine de Medicis; very curious, and in perfect preservation. There is
a duplicate of this picture in the Louvre. A much more curious picture is
a whole length, supposed to be of <EM>Agnes Sorel</EM>, mistress of
Charles VII. One minute's reflection will correct this designation of the
portrait. In the time of Agnes Sorel, portrait painting, in oil, was
unknown--at least in France. The costume betrays the misnomer: for it is
palpably not of the time of Agnes Sorel. Here is also a whole length of
<EM>Isabella, daughter of Philip II.</EM> and Governess of the Low
Countries. There are several small fancy pictures; among which I was
chiefly, and indeed greatly struck, with a woman and two children by
<EM>Stella</EM>. 'Tis a gem of its kind.</P>

Esq.</P>
</DIV>

<P>Leaving this room, you turn, to the left--into a small room, but
obscurely lighted. Here is a Virgin and Child, by <EM>Sasso Ferrato</EM>,
that cannot be surpassed. There is a freedom of design, a crispness of
touch, and a mellowness of colouring, in this picture, that render it a
performance very much above the usual representations of this subject. In
the same room is a spirited, but somewhat singular, picture of the
<EM>birth of Venus</EM>. It exhibits the conception and touch of a master.
The colouring is very sober. The name of the artist is not upon the frame,
and as I was generally alone when I made my memoranda, I had no one to
instruct me. You leave this room, and pass on--catching a glimpse of a
lawn richly bedecked with flowers and shrubs--into a long and lofty room,
which unites the two enviable distinctions of LIBRARY and GALLERY. Here
you are bewildered for an instant: that is to say, you are divided in your
attention between the admiration of the proportion and structure of the
room, and the alternate captivation of books, busts, and pictures. But as
you have had enough of <EM>paper</EM> and <EM>print</EM> in former
despatches, I shall confine myself here exclusively to the <EM>pencil</EM>
and the <EM>chisel</EM>.</P>

<P>Let us first walk leisurely about the ground floor, ere we mount the
gallery. To begin with the busts. That of the late <EM>Abbé
Barthelemi</EM>, in white marble, immediately strikes you.<A name=
"fnref_181"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_181">181</A> It is full of
nature and of character; and the hair has just enough of the antique gusto
about it to render the toute ensemble equally classical and
individualised--if you will allow this latter expression. Here is a
terra-cotta head of <EM>Corneille</EM>, of very indifferent workmanship;
and much inferior to a similar representation of him at Rouen. The
terra-cotta head of <EM>Rousseau</EM> is considerably better. But the
marble bust of <EM>Voltaire</EM>, by Houdon, throws every thing about it
into tameness. It is as fine as is the terra-cotta bust of the same person
which Denon possesses. Here, however, the poet is in a peruque, or
dress-wig. His eyes sparkle with animation. Every feature and every muscle
seems to be in action: and yet it is perfectly free from caricature or
affectation. A surprising performance. This head and that of Barthelemi
are quite perfect of their kind. And yet I am not sure whether I should
not have preferred the fine bronze bust of <EM>Henri II.</EM>, somewhat
larger than life, to either of the preceding. But I must not forget the
colossal head of <EM>Bonaparte</EM>, when a young man, by Canova. It is of
white marble: considered to be the original. Denon has a similar head, by
the same artist. I am not sure if I do not prefer Mr. Craufurd's. Of
paintings, on this floor, the head of <EM>Francis I</EM>. by
Titian--(which may be called rather a finished sketch, and which is
retouched in parts) is a very desirable performance; but it is inferior to
the same head, by the same artist, in the Louvre. Here is a charming
portrait of a Lady in the time of Louis XV., who chose to lead the life of
a <EM>Réligieuse</EM>: sweetly and naturally touched. A fine portrait of
<EM>Grotius</EM> is also here; well deserving a conspicuous place in any
cabinet of learning.<A name="fnref_182"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_182">182</A></P>

<P>We will now walk up stairs to the gallery. Of course, in the confined
space between the balustrade and the wainscot (not much more than three
feet), it is barely possible to appreciate the full effect of the
paintings; but I here send you a list of the greater part of them, with
brief remarks, upon the general accuracy of which you may rely.</P>

<P><EM>Madame Scarron</EM>, with the <EM>Duc du Maine</EM>; apparently by
Mignard: in a very fresh and perfect state.</P>

<P>A fine head of <EM>Racine</EM>, and similar one of <EM>De La
Motte</EM>.</P>

<P><EM>Mademoiselle de Guiche, Princesse de Monaco</EM>; in all
probability by Mignard. Good.</P>

<P><EM>Mademoiselle Hamilton, Comtesse de Grammont</EM>; by Mignard. If
the Comte de Grammont chose to fall in love only with beautiful women, he
could scarcely, upon his own principles, (which indeed were any thing but
moral) have found any one so lovely as was his WIFE. Yet I have seen
handsomer portraits of her than this.</P>

<P><EM>Anne de Gonzague</EM>. She was Princess Palatine, and daughter of
Charles Duke of Nevers. This is a half length portrait. A garland is in
her right hand. A gay and pleasing picture.</P>

<P><EM>Le Chancelier d'Aguesseau</EM>. By Rigaud. A fine mellow
portrait.</P>

<P><EM>Louis XI</EM>. A whole length; supposed to be by Leonardo da Vinci.
Not very credible. It is a fine, bold, horribly-looking portrait: not in
the very best state of preservation.</P>

<P><EM>Blaise Pascal</EM>. Very fine. The artist's name is not inscribed;
but there is a Murillo-like effect about this portrait, which is very
striking. Pascal holds a letter in his hand.</P>

<P>Next to Pascal is a prodigiously fine oval portrait (is it of
<EM>Fontaine</EM>?) by Rigaud. No name is subjoined.</P>

<P><EM>Comtesse de la Fayette</EM>. A fine countenance: hands apparently
recoloured. In yellow drapery.</P>

<P><EM>Julie-Lucie d'Augennes, Duchesse de Montausier.</EM> She died in
1671. The portrait is by Mignard. It represents this celebrated female,
when young, <EM>encadred</EM> by flowers. The carnation tints of the
flesh, and the blue lustre of the eye, have nothing finer in the whole
circle of Mignard's performances. This is a picture from which the eye is
withdrawn with no common reluctance. It is clear, bright, fresh, and
speaking.<A name="fnref_183"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_183">183</A></P>

<P>The <EM>Wife of P. de Champagne</EM>. She holds a small oval portrait
of the mother of her husband, the famous painter, in her lap. The picture
is by P. de Champagne himself. The head of the mother is very clever: but
the flesh has perhaps too predominant a tint of pinkish-purple
throughout.</P>

<P><EM>Madame de la Sabliere</EM>. Oval: very clever.</P>

<P><EM>Madame Deshoulieres</EM>. Similar, in both repects.</P>

<P><EM>Madame Cornuel</EM>. Oval: a stiff performance.</P>

<P><EM>Madame la Duchesse d'Orleans</EM>. She is represented as Hebe. A
pretty picture; but a little too much "frenchified."</P>

<P><EM>Madame de Staal</EM>. Oval. Beautiful and perfect.</P>

<P><EM>Madame la Marquise de Rambouillet</EM>. A° 1646. A most beautiful
picture. The head and shoulders are worthy of Vandyke. The curtain, in the
background, is flowered; and perhaps too hard.</P>

<P><EM>Madame la Duchesse de la Valliere, mère du dernier duc de ce
nom</EM>. She was the mother of the Duke de la Valliere who had the
celebrated library; and died in 1782, within three months of reaching her
hundredth year! She was an old woman, but yet very handsome, when this
portrait was painted. Her colour is yet tender, and her features are small
and regular. The eyes have unusual intelligence, for so protracted a
period of life. It is a half length, and I should think by Rigaud. She is
sitting in a chair, holding a tea spoon in her right hand, and a tea cup
in her left. This may have some allusion, of which I am ignorant. The
whole picture is full of nature, and in a fine tone of colour.</P>

<P>The <EM>Duke of Monmouth</EM>. He is sitting: holding a truncheon in
his right hand. A helmet and plume are before him. He wears a white sash.
This is a dark, but may be called a finely painted, picture. Yet the Duke
is not represented as a handsome man.</P>

<P><EM>Turenne</EM>. By P. de Champagne. Fine.</P>

<P><EM>Bossuet</EM>. By Rigaud. This is not only considered as the chef-
d'oeuvre of Rigaud, but it has been pronounced to be the finest portrait
ever executed within the last century of the French School.<A name=
"fnref_184"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_184">184</A> It is a whole
length; and is well known to you from the wonderful print of it by Drevet.
The representation is worthy of the original; for Bossuet was one of the
last of the really great men of France. He had a fine capacity and fine
scholarship: and was as adroit in polemics as Richelieu was in politics.
He resembled somewhat our Horsley in his pulpit eloquence,--and was almost
as pugnacious and overbearing in controversy. He excelled in quickness of
perception, strength of argument, and vehemence of invective; yet his
sermons are gradually becoming neglected--while those of Fenelon,
Massillon, and Saurin are constantly resorted to ... for the fine taste,
pure feeling, and Christianlike consolation which breathe throughout them.
One thing, in this fine whole length portrait of Bossuet, cannot fail to
be noticed by the curious. The head seems to have been separately painted,
on a small square piece of canvass, and <EM>let into</EM> the picture.</P>

<P>There is certainly a <EM>rifacimento</EM> of some kind or other; which
should denote the head to have been twice painted.</P>

<P><EM>C. Paulin</EM>. By Champagne. Paulin was first confessor to Louis
XIV.; and had therefore, I should apprehend, enough upon his hands. This
is a fine portrait.</P>

<P><EM>William III</EM>. Harsh and stiff. It is a performance (as most of
those of William seem to be) for the model of a head of a ship.</P>

<P><EM>Colbert, Evéque de Montpellier</EM>. A fine head.</P>

<P><EM>Fléchier, Evéque de Nismes</EM>. A very fine portrait. The name of
the painter does not appear.</P>

<P>A fine half length portrait of a <EM>Marshal of France</EM>, with a
truncheon in his hand. Both the hands are beautifully drawn and
coloured.</P>

<P><EM>Maréchal duc d'Harcourt</EM>. By Rigaud.</P>

<P><EM>Eliz. Angelique de Montmorenci, Duchesse de Chatillon</EM>. She
died in 1695 in her 69th year. This is a fine picture, but injured and
retouched. The left hand rests upon a lion's head.</P>

<P><EM>F. Marie de Bourbon, fille de Madame de Montespan, et femme du
Régent</EM>. A stiffish picture; but the countenance is pleasing.</P>

<P><EM>Madame la Duchesse de Névers, fille de Madame de Thianges, et nièce
de Madame de Montespan</EM>. A bow is in her right hand, and a dog in her
left. The countenance is beautiful and well painted. The eyes and mouth in
particular have great sweetness of expression.</P>

<P><EM>Duc de Montausier</EM>; in a hat and red feather. By Rigaud.</P>

<P><EM>Madame la Duchesse de Sforce: fille cadette de Madame de
Thianges</EM>. A small whole length, sitting: with two greyhounds in her
lap, and a third at her side.</P>

<P><EM>Le Ministre Colbert</EM>. By Mignard. A fine picture.<A name=
"fnref_185"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_185">185</A></P>

<P><EM>Marie Leezinska, femme de Louis XV</EM>. A cleverly painted
head.</P>

<P><EM>Le Cardinal Mazarin</EM>. By P. de Champagne. Whole length. A fine
portrait--which I never contemplate without thinking of the poor
unfortunate "man in an iron mask!"</P>

<P><EM>Madame de Motteville</EM>. She died in her 74th year, in 1689. This
is merely the head and shoulders; but in the Vandyke style of
execution.</P>

<P><EM>Charles Paris d'Orleans, dernier Duc de Longueville.</EM> He was
killed in the famous passage of the Rhine, at Tolhuys, in 1672.</P>

<P><EM>Charles I</EM>. By Vandyke. A beautiful half length portrait.
Perhaps too highly varnished.</P>

<P><EM>Le Marquis de Cinq-Mars</EM>. He was beheaded at the age of twenty-
two, in September 1642. There is also a whole length of him, in a rich,
white, flowered dress. A genuine and interesting picture.</P>

<P><EM>Mary Queen of Scots</EM>. Whole length: in a white dress. A copy;
or, if an old picture, repainted all over.</P>

<P><EM>Don Carlos</EM>, the unfortunate son of Philip II. of Spain. A
beautiful youth; but this picture, alleged to have been painted by Alfonso
Sanchez Coello, must be a copy.</P>

<P>The foregoing are the principal decorations along the gallery of this
handsome and interesting room. In an adjoining closet, where were once two
or three portraits of Bonaparte, is a beautiful and highly finished small
whole length of <EM>Philip Duke of Orleans</EM>, Regent of France. Also a
whole length of <EM>Marmontel</EM>, sitting; executed in crayon. The
curiously carved frame, in a brown-coloured wood, in which this latter
drawing is contained, is justly an object of admiration with visitors. I
have scarcely seen a more appropriate ornament, for a choice cabinet, than
this estimable portrait of Marmontel. Here are portraits of
<EM>Neckar</EM>, and <EM>Clement Marot</EM>, in crayons: the latter a
copy. Here is, too, a cleverly painted portrait of <EM>L. de
Boulogne</EM>.</P>

<P>We descend--to a fourth room, or rather to a richly furnished
cabinet--below stairs. Every thing here is "en petit." Whether whole
lengths, or half lengths, they are representations in miniature. What is
this singular portrait, which strikes one to the left, on entering? Can it
be so? Yes ... DIANE DE POICTIERS again! She yet lives every where in
France. 'Tis a strange performance; but I have no hesitation in calling it
AN ORIGINAL ... although in parts it has been palpably retouched. But the
features--and especially the eyes--(those "glasses of the soul," as old
Boiastuau calls them<A name="fnref_186"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_186">186</A>) seem to retain their former lustre and expression. This
highly curious portrait is a half length, measuring only ten inches by
about eight. It represents the original without any drapery, except a
crimson mantle thrown over her back. She is leaning upon her left arm,
which is supported by a bank. A sort of tiara is upon her head. Her hair
is braided. Above her, within a frame, is the following inscription, in
capital roman letters: "<EM>Comme le Cerf brait après le décours des
Eaues; ainsi brait mon Ame, après Toy, ô Dieu</EM>." Ps. XLII. Upon the
whole, this is perhaps the most legitimate representation of the original
which France possesses.<A name="fnref_187"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_187">187</A></P>

<P>In the same boudoir is a small and beautifully coloured head of
<EM>Francis I.</EM> Here is a portrait of the famous <EM>Duchess of
Portsmouth</EM>, on horseback, in red; and another of the <EM>Duchess of
Nevers</EM>, in a blue riding jacket. But much more estimable, and highly
to be prized--as works of art--- are the TWO MURILLOS: one, apparently of
St. Francis, which was always religiously preserved in the bed-chamber of
Madame de Maintenon, having been given to her by Louis XIV. The other,
although fine, has less general interest. I could hardly sufficiently
admire the whole length of <EM>Jacques Callot</EM>, painted by himself. It
is delicious, of its kind. There is a very curious and probably coeval
picture representing whole length portraits of the <EM>Cardinals of Guise
and Lorraine</EM>, and the <EM>Dukes of Guise and Mayenne</EM>,<A name=
"fnref_188"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_188">188</A> The figures are
very small, but appear to be faithful representations. An old portrait of
<EM>Louis Roi de Sicile, Père de Réné</EM>,--a small head, supposed to be
of the fifteenth century--is sufficiently singular, but I take this to be
a copy. Yet the likeness may be correct. A whole length of
<EM>Washington</EM>, with a black servant holding his horse, did not
escape my attention. Nor, as an antiquary, could I refuse bestowing
several minutes attention upon the curious old portrait (supposed to be by
<EM>Jean de Bruges</EM>) of <EM>Charlotte, Wife of Louis XI.</EM> It is
much in the style of the old illuminations. In one of the lower rooms, I
forget which, is a portrait of Bonaparte; the upper part of the same
representation of him which appeared in London from the pencil of David.
He is placed by the side of a portrait (of the same dimensions) of his
conqueror, Wellington: but I am not much disposed to admire the style of
execution of our hero. It is a stiff, formal, and severely executed
picture. Assuredly the present school of French portrait painters is most
egregiously defective in expression; while ours, since the days of
Reynolds, has maintained a most decided superiority. I believe I have now
noticed every thing that is more particularly deserving of attention in
the Collection of Mr. Quintin Craufurd ... But I cannot retrace my steps
without again expressing my admiration of the <EM>local</EM> of this
little domain. The garden, offices, and neighbourhood render it one of the
most desirable residences in Paris.<A name="fnref_189"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_189">189</A></P>

<P>As I happen to be just now in the humour for gossiping about the fine
arts, suppose I take you with me to the collection of paintings of the
MARQUIS DE SOMMARIVA, in the <EM>Rue du Bas Rempart</EM>? It is among the
most distinguished, and the most celebrated, in Paris; but I should say it
is rather eminent for sculpture than for painting. It is here that Canova
reigns without a rival. The early acquaintance and long tried friend of
the Marquis, that unrivalled sculptor has deposited here what he considers
to be the <EM>chef-d'oeuvre</EM> of his art, as a single figure. Of
course, I speak of his <EM>Magdalen</EM>. But let me be methodical. The
open day for the inspection of his treasures is <EM>Friday</EM>.</P>

<P>When I entered, not a creature was in the rooms. The general effect was
splendid and imposing. I took out my memorandum-book, and went directly to
work; noticing only those subjects which appeared, on one account or
other, to be more particularly deserving of attention. There is a pretty
picture of CUPID AND PSYCHE, by <EM>Carlo Cignani</EM>; the simple and
quiet effect of which is much heightened by being contrasted with the very
worst representation of the <EM>same subject</EM>, which I ever saw, by
<EM>David</EM>: painted last year at Brussels. How the Marquis can afford
so many square yards of his walls for the reception of such a performance,
is almost marvellous. It is, throughout, in the worst possible taste. The
countenance of Cupid, who is sitting on the bed or couch with the vacant
grin of an ideot, is that of a negro. It is dark, and of an utterly inane
expression. The colouring is also too ruddy throughout. Near to this
really heartless picture, is one of a woman flying; well drawn, and rather
tenderly coloured. Opposite, is a picture of Venus supported in the air by
a group of Cupids. The artist is <EM>Prudhon</EM>. In the general glare of
colour, which distinguishes the French school, it is absolutely refreshing
to have the eye soothed by something like an attempt, as in this picture,
at a mellow chiaro-oscuro. It has undoubted merit. It is, upon the whole,
finely coloured; but the countenance of Venus is so pale as to have an
almost deathly effect. It is intended to represent her as snatched away
from the sight of her dead Adonis.</P>

<P>In common courtesy I must make but brief mention of a very clumsy, and
ill-drawn child, by De Broisefremont: and hasten, in the next room, to the
magnificent picture of <EM>Diana and Endymion</EM>, painted by Guerin in
1810, and lately engraved. This picture is a very fair illustration of the
merits and demerits of the FRENCH SCHOOL OF PAINTING. The drawing of
Endymion is, upon the whole, good; but a palpable copy of the antique.
This necessarily gives it somewhat an air of affectation. The shepherd
lies upon a bed of clouds, (terminated by an horizon which is warmed by
the rays of a setting sun) very gracefully and perhaps naturally. He seems
to sleep soundly. His whole figure and countenance glow with the warmth of
beauty and youth. I will not disturb his slumbers by finding the least
fault--even with the disposition of the extremities. But his nightly
visitor--the enamoured goddess--is, of all female figures which I have
ever seen upon canvass, one of the most affected, meagre, and
uninteresting. Diana has been exchanged for an opera dancer. The waist is
pinched in, the attitude is full of conceit, and there is a dark shadow
about the neck, as if she had been trying some previous experiment with a
<EM>rope</EM>! Endymion could never open his eyes to gaze upon a figure so
utterly unworthy of the representation of an enamoured deity.<A name=
"fnref_190"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_190">190</A> The Cupids must
also be condemned; for they are poor in form, and indifferent in
execution. The back ground has considerable merit: but I fear the picture
is too highly glazed. In this room also is the famous picture of
<EM>Belisarius</EM>, engraved with so much éclat by Desnoyers. I own that
I like the engraving better than the painting; for I see no occasion for
such a disproportionate quantity of warm colouring as this picture
exhibits.</P>

<P>Pope (in his Epistle to Jarvis, I think) says of artists, that, "to
paint the naked is their dear delight." No artists ever delighted so much
in this branch of painting as the French. Does not this taste argue a
want--not only of respect, but--of <EM>feeling?</EM> It was therefore
pleasing to me, my dear friend, to turn my attention from the studied
display of naked goddesses, in the collection of the worthy Marquis of
Sommariva, towards objects a little more qualified to gratify the higher
feelings connected with art:--and the first thing which soothed me, when I
<EM>had</EM> so turned my attention, was, the <EM>Terpsichore</EM> of
<EM>Canova</EM>. You know it from the print by Morghen. The countenance,
to my eye, is the perfection of female beauty:--yet it is a countenance
which seems to be the abstract--the result of study, and of
combination--rather than of beauty, as seen "in mortal race which walks
the earth." The drapery appears to be studiously neglected--giving it the
appearance of the antique, which had been battered and bruised by the
casualties of some two thousand years. By this, I mean that the folds are
not only numerous, but the intermediate parts are not marked by that
degree of precision and finish, which, in my opinion, they ought to have
received. Yet the whole has an enchantingly simple air: at once classical,
pure, and impressive. The Marquis has indeed great reason to be proud of
it.</P>

<P>But if I pat the right cheek of Canova with one hand, I must cuff his
left cheek with the other. Here is a Cupid by him, executed in 1787. It is
evidently the production of a mind not ripened to its fullest powers. In
other words, I should call it "a poor, flat thing."</P>

<P>We approach the far-famed MAGDALEN. Immediately opposite the boudoir,
where the last mentioned treasures are deposited, you observe a door, or
aperture, half covered with silken drapery of a greyish brown tint. There
was something mysterious in the appearance, and equally so in the
approach. I had no intimation of what it led to; for, as I told you, not a
creature besides myself was in the rooms. With a gently raised hand I drew
the drapery aside, entered ... and looked before me. There stood the
MAGDALEN. There she was, (more correctly speaking) kneeling; in anguish
and wretchedness of soul--her head hanging down--contemplating a scull and
cross, which were supported by her knees. Her dishevelled hair flowed
profusely over her back and shoulders. Her cheeks were sunk. Her eyes were
hollow. Her attitude was lowly and submissive. You could not look at her
without feeling pity and compassion.</P>

<P>Such, in few words, is the Magdalen of Canova. For the first five
minutes I was lost in surprise and admiration. The windows are hid by
white curtains; and the interior is hung all over with the same grey silk
drapery, before noticed. A glass, placed behind the figure, affords you a
view of the back while you are contemplating the front. This is very
ingenious; but it is probably too artificial. The effect of the room,
however--from the silken drapery with which it is entirely covered--is,
although studied, upon the whole excellent. Of course the minutes flew
away quickly in such a place, and before such an object; and I think I
viewed the figure, in every possible direction, for full three quarters of
an hour. The result of that view--after the first feelings of admiration
had subsided--I proceeded forthwith to impart: and shall be most happy to
be set right if I have erred, in the conclusion which I draw. In truth,
there can be only one or two little supposed impeachments of the artist's
judgment, in the contemplation of this extraordinary figure. The Magdalen
has probably too much of the abject expression of <EM>mendicity</EM> in
her attitude; and, for a creature thus poor and prostrate, one is
surprised to find her gazing upon a <EM>golden</EM> cross. It is a piece
of finery ill placed in the midst of such wretchedness. But Canova is fond
of gilt; yet what is appropriate in <EM>Hebe</EM> may be discordant in the
<EM>Magdalen</EM>. This penitent creature, here so touchingly expressed,
is deeply wrapped in meditation upon her crucified Master. She has
forsaken the world ... to follow the cross!--but surely this idea would
have been more powerfully expressed, if the cross had <EM>not</EM> been
<EM>visible</EM>?. Was this object necessary to tell the tale?--or,
rather, did not the sculptor deem it necessary to <EM>balance</EM> (as is
called) the figure? Nor am I over well satisfied with the scull. It is
common-place. At any rate, if scull and cross must be there, I wish the
cross had been simply of stone--as is the scull.</P>

<P>My next objection relates to a somewhat more important point. I think
the <EM>face</EM> and <EM>figure</EM> do not seem to belong to the
<EM>same</EM> human being: the former is shrunken, ghastly, and indicative
of extreme constitutional debility: the latter is plump, well formed, and
bespeaks a subject in the enjoyment of full health. Can such an union,
therefore, be quite correct? In the different views of this figure,
especially in profile, or behind, you cannot fail to be struck with the
general beauty of the form; but this beauty arises from its fulness and
just proportion. In gazing upon it, in front, you are pained by the view
of a countenance shrunk almost to emaciation! Can this be in nature? And
do not mental affliction and bodily debility generally go together? The
old painters, even as far back as the time of illuminators of books, used
to represent the Magdalen as plump, even to fatness,--and stout in all
respects; but her <EM>countenance</EM> usually partook of this vigour of
stamina. It was full, rosy, and healthful. The older artists sometimes
placed the Magdalen in a very awkward, and perhaps impossible, situation;
and she was even made to be buried up to the bosom in earth--still
exercising her devotions. Canova has doubtless displayed great pathos in
the wretched aspect, and humiliated attitude, of his Magdalen; but he has,
at the same time, not been inattentive to beauty of form. I only wish she
appeared to be in as good condition as the <EM>torso</EM> indicates. A
fastidious observer might say the figure was not <EM>quite balanced</EM>,
and that she must fall backward--if she retained such an attitude for a
quarter of an hour. But this is hyper-criticism. The date of the execution
of this figure is 1796: and parts of it clearly indicate that, if the
sculptor were now to re-execute it, he would have paid even yet more
attention to the finishing of the hair. Upon the whole, however, it is a
masterly effort of modern art.</P>

<P>It is almost fixed that we leave Paris within a week or ten days from
hence:--and then, for green fields, yellow corn, running streams, ripened
fruit, and all the rural evidences of a matured summer.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XI.</H3>

<P>NOTICE OF M. WILLEMIN'S MONUMENS FRANÇAIS INÉDITS. MISCELLANEOUS
ANTIQUITIES. PRESENT STATE OF THE FINE ARTS. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS UPON THE
NATIONAL CHARACTER.</P>

<P><EM>July</EM> 8, 1818.</P>

<P>I rejoice that it is in my power once more--and certainly for the last
time, from hence--to address you upon a few subjects, which, from your
earlier replies to my Paris letters, you seem to think that I have lost
sight of. These subjects, relate chiefly to ANTIQUITIES. Be assured that I
have never, for one moment, been indifferent to them; but in the vast
bibliographical field which the public libraries of this place held out
for my perambulation, it was impossible, in the first instance, not to
take advantage of the curious, and probably useful information, to be
derived from thence.</P>

<P>I must begin therefore by telling you that I had often heard of the
unassuming and assiduous author of the <EM>Monumens Français Inédits</EM>,
and was resolved to pay him a visit. I found him in the <EM>Rue
Babile</EM> towards the eastern end of the Rue St. Honoré, living on the
third floor. Several young females were in the ante-room, colouring the
plates of that work; which are chiefly in outline and in aqua-tint. Each
livraison contains six plates, at twelve francs the livraison. The form is
folio, and about twenty-eight numbers are printed.<A name=
"fnref_191"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_191">191</A> There is something
in them of every thing: furniture, dresses, houses, castles, churches,
stained glass, paintings, and sculpture. Illuminated MSS. are as freely
laid under contribution as are the outsides and insides of buildings, of
whatsoever description. Indeed I hardly ever visited the Public Library
without finding M. Willemin busied, with his pencil and tracing paper,
with some ancient illuminated MS. The style of art in the publication here
noticed, is, upon the whole, feeble; but as the price of the work is
moderate, no purchaser can reasonably complain. The variety and quantity
of the embellishments will always render M. Willemin's work an acceptable
inmate in every well-chosen library. I recommend it to you strongly;
premising, that the author professedly discards all pretension to profound
or very critical antiquarian learning.</P>

<P>For himself, M. Willemin is among the most enthusiastic, but most
modest, of his antiquarian brethren. He has seen better days. His abode
and manners afford evidence that he was once surrounded by comparative
affluence and respectability. A picture of his deceased wife hung over the
chimney-piece. The back-ground evinced a gaily furnished apartment. "Yes,
Sir, (said M.W.--on observing that I noticed it) such was <EM>once</EM> my
room, and its <EM>chief ornament</EM>"--Of course I construed the latter
to be his late wife. "Alas! (resumed he) in better days, I had six
splendid cabinets filled with curiosities. I have now--not a single one!
Such is life." He admitted that his publication brought him a very
trifling profit; and that, out of his own country, he considered the
<EM>London</EM> market as the most advantageous to him. A large broken
phial, containing water and a fleur-de-lis in full bloom, was the only,
ornament of his mantle piece. "Have you no curiosities of any kind--(said
I to him) for sale?" "None--" replied he; but he had <EM>drawings</EM> of
a few. "Have the kindness to shew me some of these drawings"--and
forthwith appeared the case and <EM>pocket-knife of Diane de
Poictiers</EM>, drawn from the original by Langlois. "Where is the
original?" observed I, hastily. "Ha, Sir, you are not singular in your
question. A nobleman of your country was almost losing his wits because he
could not purchase it:--and yet, this original was once to be obtained for
<EM>twenty louis</EM>!" I confess I was glad to obtain the drawing of
Langlois for two napoleons. It is minutely and prettily executed, and
apparently with great fidelity.</P>

<P>M. Willemin proceeded to shew me a few more drawings for his national
work, telling me precisely what he <EM>meant</EM>, and what he did
<EM>not</EM> mean, to publish. His own drawings with a pen are, some of
them, of a masterly execution; and although of a less brilliant and less
classical style than those of LE NOIR, M. Willemin is still an artist of
whom his country will always have reason to be proud. I bought several
drawings of him.<A name="fnref_192"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_192">192</A> One represents the sculptured figures upon the outside
of the <EM>grand portal</EM> of the <EM>Cathedral of Chartres.</EM> These
figures seem to be of the thirteenth century. The other drawing is of a
rich piece of <EM>fayence</EM>, or of painted and glazed earthenware dish,
and about the middle of the sixteenth century: of which I remember to have
seen some very curious specimens at Denon's. But nothing can be more
singular, and at the same time more beautiful of its kind, than the
present specimen--supposed to be the work of the famous Bernard Palissy.
Paris is full of such treasures.</P>

<P>Of all cities, PARIS is probably that which abounds with rich and
curious relics of ancient art. Its churches, its palaces, its public
buildings--sometimes grotesque and sometimes magnificent--furnish alike
subjects for admiration and materials for collection. But the genius of
the French does not lie in this pursuit. From the commencement of the
sixteenth century, the ANTIQUITIES OF PARIS might have supplied a critical
antiquary with matter for a publication which could have been second only
to the immortal work of Piranesi. But with the exception of Montfaucon,
(which I admit to be a most splendid exception) and recently of MILLIN and
LE NOIR, France hardly boasts of an indigenous Antiquary. In our own
country, we have good reason to be proud of this department of literature.
The names of Leland, Camden, Cotton, Dugdale, Gibson, Tanner, Gough, and
Lysons, place us even upon a level with the antiquarians of Italy. It was
only the other day that M. Willemin was urging me, on my return to
England, to take <EM>Beauvais</EM> in my way, in order to pay a visit to
Madame la Comtesse de G., living at a chateau about three leagues from
that place. She possesses a collection of carved wood, in bas-reliefs,
porches, stair-cases, &amp;c. all from a neighbouring dilapidated abbey;
and, among other things, one singular piece of sculpture, descriptive of
the temptation of St Anthony. He had reason to think that the Countess
might be more successfully tempted than was the Saint just mentioned; in
other words, that these things were to be had rather for "money" than for
"love."</P>

<P>For specimens of the costume of the lower classes, the <EM>south</EM>
side of the Seine must be chiefly visited. The great streets which lead
thither are those of <EM>St. Victor, St. Jaques</EM>, and <EM>De La
Harpe</EM>. Mr. Lewis had frequently strolled to this quarter of Paris;
and his attention was one morning particularly directed to a group of
<EM>Blanchisseuses</EM>--who were halting beneath their burdens to have a
little gossip with each other. See how characteristically he has treated
the subject.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><IMG width="100%"
src="images/333.png" alt=
"Blanchisseuses"></DIV>

<P>One of the causes of the want of encouragement in NATIONAL ANTIQUITIES,
among the French, may arise from the natural love of the people for what
is gay and gaudy, rather than for what is grave and instructive. And yet,
when will nations learn that few things tend so strongly to keep alive a
pure spirit of PATRIOTISM as <EM>such</EM> a study or pursuit? As we
reverence the past, so do we anticipate the future. To love what our
forefathers have done in arts, in arms, or in learning, is to lay the
surest foundation for a proper respect for our own memories in after ages.
But with Millin, I fear, the study of Archaeology will sleep soundly, if
not expire, among the Parisians. VISCONTI has doubtless left a splendid
name behind him here; but Visconti was an Italian. No; my friend--the ARTS
have recently taken an exclusive turn for the admiration, even to
adoration, of portrait and historical painters: No LYSONSES, no BLORES, no
MACKENZIES are patronised either at Paris or in the other great cities of
France. I must however make an honourable exception in favour of the
direction given to the splendid talents of MADAME JAQUOTOT. And I cannot,
in common justice, omit, on this occasion, paying a very sincere tribute
of respect to the PRESENT KING<A name="fnref_193"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_193">193</A>--who has really been instrumental to this
direction. I have lately paid this clever lady a morning visit, with a
letter of introduction from our common friend M. Langlès. As I was very
courteously received, I begged that I might only see such specimens of her
art as would give her the least possible trouble, and afford me at the
same time an opportunity of judging of her talents.</P>

<P>Madame Jaquotot was as liberal in the display of her productions, as
she was agreeable and polite in her conversation. I saw all her
performances. Her copies of Leonardo da Vinci and Guido, in black crayons,
are beautiful of their kind; but her enamel copies, upon porcelaine, of
the <EM>Portraits of the more celebrated Characters of
France</EM>--executed at the desire and expense of his Majesty--perfectly
delighted me. The plan is as excellent as its execution is perfect. But
such performances have not been accomplished without a heavy previous
expense, on the score of experiments. I was told that the artist had sunk
a sum little short of five or six hundred pounds sterling, in the
different processes for trying and fixing her colours. But she seems now
to walk upon firm ground, and has nothing but an abundant harvest to look
forward to. Indeed, for every portrait, square, or oval, (although
scarcely more than <EM>three inches</EM> in height) she receives a hundred
louis d'or. This is a truly princely remuneration: but I do not consider
it overpaid. Some of the earlier portraits are taken from illuminated
manuscripts; and, among them, I quickly recognised that of my old friend
<EM>Anne of Brittany</EM>,--head and shoulders only: very brilliant and
characteristic--but Mr. Lewis is "yet a painter."</P>

<P>As all these bijoux (amounting perhaps to twelve or fifteen in number)
were displayed before me, I fancied I was conversing with the very
Originals themselves. The whole length of <EM>Henri IV</EM>., of the same
size as the original in the Louvre, is probably the chef d'oeuvre of
Madame Jaquotot. It is exquisitely perfect. When she comes down to the
reign of Louis XIV., she has necessarily recourse to the originals of
PETITOT; of which the Louvre contains a precious glazed case, enclosing
about four or five dozen, of them. Here again the copyist treads closely
upon the heels of her predecessor; while her portrait of <EM>Anne of
Austria</EM> comes fully up to every thing we discover in the original.
Upon the whole, I spent a pleasant and most instructive hour with this
accomplished lady; and sincerely wish that all talents, like hers, may
receive a similar direction and meet with an equally liberal reward. You
must not fail to bear in mind that, in my humble judgment, this department
of art belongs strictly to NATIONAL ANTIQUITIES.</P>

<P>For <EM>one</EM>, who would turn his horse's head towards Madame
Jaquotot's dwelling, in the <EM>Rue Jacob</EM>, fifty would fly with
rapture to view a whole length by GÉRARD, or a group by DAVID. In portrait
painting, and historical composition, these are the peculiar heroes. None
dare walk within their circle: although I think GIRODET may sometimes
venture to measure swords with the latter. Would you believe it? The other
day, when dining with some smart, lively, young Parisians, I was compelled
to defend RAFFAELLE against David? the latter being considered by them
<EM>superior</EM> to the Italian artist in a <EM>knowledge of
drawing</EM>. Proh pudor! This will remind you of Jervas's celebrated
piece of nonsensical flattery to himself--when, on Pope's complimenting
that artist upon one of his portraits, he compassionately exclaimed
"<EM>Poor little Tit</EM>!"--Surely all these national prejudices are as
unwise as they are disgusting. Of Gérard, I would wish to speak with
respect; but an artist, who receives from fifteen to twenty thousand
francs for the painting of a whole length portrait, stands upon an
eminence which exposes him to the observation of every man. In the same
degree, also, does his elevation provoke the criticism of every man. But,
however respectfully I may wish to speak of Gérard, I do not, in my
conscience, consider him superior to what may be called the <EM>second
rate</EM> class of portrait-painters in England.<A name="fnref_194"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_194">194</A> His outline is often hard, and full
of affectation of a knowledge of drawing: his colouring is as frequently
severe and metallic, and there is rarely any expression of mind or soul in
his faces. I saw at Laugier's the other day, his portrait of Madame de
Stael--painted from <EM>recollection</EM>. He certainly had
<EM>forgotten</EM> how to <EM>colour</EM> when he executed it. Forster (a
very clever, sensible, and amiable young man) is busied, or rather has
just finished, the engraving of a portrait of the Duke of Wellington, by
the same painter. What has depended upon <EM>him</EM> has been charmingly
done: but the figure of the great Original--instead of giving you the
notion of the FIRST CAPTAIN OF HIS AGE<A name="fnref_195"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_195">195</A>--is a poor, trussed-up, unmeaning piece of
composition: looking-out of the canvas with a pair of eyes, which, instead
of seeming to anticipate and frustrate (as they <EM>have</EM> done) the
movements of his adversary, as if by magic, betray an almost torpidity or
vacancy of expression! The attitude is equally unnatural and ungraceful.
Another defect, to my eye, in Gérard's portraits, is, the quantity of
flaunting colour and glare of varnish with which his canvas is
covered.</P>

<P>The French cognoscenti swear by "the <EM>swearing of the Horatii</EM>"
of David. I saw a reduced copy of the large picture at the Luxembourg, by
the artist himself--at Didot's: and it was while discussing the
comparative merits and demerits of this famous production, that I ventured
to observe that Raffaelle would have drawn the hands better. A
simultaneous shout of opposition followed the remark. I could scarcely
preserve common gravity or decorum: but as my antagonists were serious, I
was also resolved to enact a serious part. It is not necessary to trouble
you with a summary of my remarks; although I am persuaded I never talked
so much French, without interruption, for so long a space of time.
However, my opponents admitted, with a little reluctance, that, if the
hands of the Horatii were not ill drawn, the <EM>position</EM> of them was
sufficiently affected. I then drew their attention, to the <EM>Cupid and
Psyche</EM> of the same master, in the collection of the Marquis of
Sommariva, (in the notice of which my last letter was pretty liberal) but
I had here a less obstinate battle to encounter. It certainly appeared
(they admitted) that David did not improve as he became older.</P>

<P>Among the Painters of eminence I must not forget to mention LAURENT.
The French are not very fond of him, and certainly they under-rate his
talents. As a colourist, some of his satins may vie with those of
Vanderwerf. He paints portraits, in small, as well as fancy-subjects. Of
the former, that of his daughter is beautifully executed. Of the latter,
his <EM>Young Falconer</EM> is a production of the most captivating kind.
But it is his <EM>Joan of Arc</EM> which runs away with the prize of
admiration. The Government have purchased the house in which that
celebrated female was born,<A name="fnref_196"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_196">196</A> and over the door of which an ancient statue of her is
to be seen. Laurent's portrait is also purchased to be placed over the
chimney-piece of the room; and it is intended to supply furniture, of the
character which it originally might have possessed.</P>

<P>But if France cannot now boast her Mignard, Rigaud, or the Poussins,
she has reason to be proud of her present race of <EM>Engravers</EM>. Of
these, DESNOYERS evidently takes the lead. He is just now in Italy, and I
shall probably not see him--having twice called in vain. I own
undisguisedly that I am charmed with all his performances; and especially
with his sacred subjects from Raffaelle:--whom, it is just possible, he
may consider to be a somewhat better draftsman than David. There is hardly
any thing but what he adorns by his touch. He may consider the whole
length portrait of <EM>Bonaparte</EM> to be his chef-d'oeuvre; but his
<EM>Vierge au Linge, Vierge dite la Belle Jardinière</EM>,--and perhaps,
still finer, that called <EM>au Donataire</EM>--are infinitely preferable,
to my taste. The portrait has too much of detail. It is a combination of
little parts; of flowered robes, with a cabinet-like background: every
thing being almost mechanical, and the shield of the ex-Emperor having all
the elaborate minutiæ of Grignion. I am heretic enough to prefer the
famous whole length of poor Louis XVI, by Bervic after Callet: there is
such a flow of line and gracefulness of expression in this latter
performance! But Desnoyers has uncommon force, as well as sweetness and
tenderness, in the management of historical subjects: although I think
that his recent production of <EM>Eliezer and Rebecca</EM>, from
<EM>Nicolo Poussin</EM>, is unhappy--as to choice. His females have great
elegance. His line never flows more freely than in the treatment of his
female figures; yet he has nothing of the style of finishing of our
STRANGE. His <EM>Francis</EM> I, and <EM>Marguerite de Valois</EM> is, to
my eye, one of the most finished, successful, and interesting of his
performances. It is throughout a charming picture, and should hang over
half the mantle pieces in the kingdom. His portrait of <EM>Talleyrand</EM>
is brilliant; but there are parts very much too black. It will bear no
comparison with the glorious portrait of our <EM>John Hunter</EM>, by
Sharp--from Sir J. Reynolds. Desnoyers engraves only for himself: that is
to say, he is the sole proprietor of his performances, and report speaks
him to be in the receipt of some twenty-five thousand francs per annum. He
deserves all he has gained--both in fortune and reputation.</P>

<P>MASSARD works in the same school with Desnoyers. He is harder in his
style of outline as well as of finishing; but he understands his subject
thoroughly, and treats it with skill and effect. ANDOUIN is lately come
out with a whole length portrait of the present king: a palpable copy, as
to composition, of that of his late brother. There are parts of the detail
most exquisitely managed, but the countenance is rather too severely
marked. LIGNON is the prince of portrait-engravers. His head of
<EM>Mademoiselle Mars</EM>--though, upon the whole, exhibiting a flat, and
unmeaning countenance, when we consider that it represents the first comic
actress in Europe--is a master-piece of graphic art. It is wrought with
infinite care, brilliancy, and accuracy. The lace, over the lady's
shoulder, may bid defiance even to what Drevet and Masson have effected of
the like kind. The eyes and the gems of Mademoiselle Mars seem to sparkle
with a rival lustre; but the countenance is too flat, and the nose wants
elevation and beauty. For this latter, however, neither Gérard nor Lignon
are amenable to criticism. Upon the whole, it is a very surprising
performance. If I were called upon to notice Lignon's chef d'oeuvre, I
would mention the frontispiece to the magnificent impression of
<EM>Camoens' Lusiad</EM>, containing the head of the author, surrounded by
an arabesque border of the most surprising brilliancy of composition and
execution. You must however remember, that it is in the splendid work
entitled LE MUSÉE FRANÇAIS, that many fine specimens of all the artists
just mentioned are to be found. There is no occasion to be more particular
in the present place.</P>

<P>I must not omit the notice of FORSTER and LAUGIER: both of whom I have
visited more than once. At the same time, I beg it may be distinctly
understood that the omission of the names of <EM>other</EM> engravers is
no implication that they are passed over as being unworthy of regard. On
the contrary, there are several whom I could mention who might take
precedence even of the two last noticed. Some of Forster's academic
figures, which gained him the prize, are very skilfully treated; both as
to drawing and finishing. His print of <EM>Titian's Mistress</EM>
exhibits, in the face and bosom of the female, a power and richness of
effect which may contend with some of the best efforts of Desnoyers's
burin. The reflex-light, in the mirror behind, is admirably managed; but
the figure of Titian, and the lower parts of his Mistress--especially the
arms and hands--are coarse, black, and inharmonious. His
<EM>Wellington</EM> is a fine performance, as to mechanical skill. M.
Bénard, the well-known print-seller to his Majesty, living on the
<EM>Boulevards Italiens</EM>, laughed with me the other day at the rival
Wellington--painted by Lawrence, and engraved by Bromley,--as a piece of
very inferior art! But men may laugh on the wrong side of the face. I
consider, however, that what has depended upon Forster, has been done with
equal ability and truth. Undoubtedly the great failing of the picture is,
that it can hardly be said to have even a faint resemblance of the
original.</P>

<P>M. Laugier has not yet reached his full powers of maturity; but what he
has done is remarkable for feeling and force. His <EM>Daphne and
Chloe</EM>, and <EM>Hero and Leander</EM> are early performances, but they
are full of promise, and abound in excellences. Colour and feeling are
their chief merit. The latter print has the shadows too dark. The former
is more transparent, more tender, and in better keeping. The foreground
has, in some parts, the crispness and richness of Woollett. They tell me
that it is a rare print, and that only 250 copies were struck off--at the
expense of the Society of Arts. Laugier has recently executed a very
elaborate print of Leander, just in the act of reaching the shore--(where
his mistress is trembling for his arrival in a lighted watch-tower) but
about to be buried in the overwhelming waves. The composition of the
figure is as replete with affectation, as its position is unnatural, if
not impossible. The waves seem to be suspended over him--on purpose to
shew off his limbs to every degree of advantage. He is perfectly canopied
by their "gracefully-curled tops." The engraving itself is elaborate to
excess: but too stiff, even to a metallic effect. It can never be popular
with us; and will, I fear, find but few purchasers in the richly garnished
repertoire of the worthy Colnaghi. Indeed it is a painful, and almost
repulsive, subject. Laugier's portrait of <EM>Le Vicomte de
Chateaubriand</EM> exhibits his prevailing error of giving blackness,
rather than depth, to his shadows. Black hair, a black cravat, and black
collar to the coat--with the lower part of the background almost "gloomy
as night"--are not good accessories. This worthy engraver lives at present
with his wife, an agreeable and unaffected little woman, up four pair of
stairs, in the <EM>Rue de Paradis</EM>. I told him--and as I thought with
the true spirit of prediction--that, on a second visit to Paris I should
find him descended--full two stories: in proportion as he was ascending in
fortune and fame.</P>

<P>The French are either not fond of, or they do not much patronise,
engraving in the <EM>stippling</EM> manner: "<EM>au poinctilliet</EM>"--as
they term it. Roger is their chief artist in this department. He is
clever, undoubtedly; but his shadows are too black, and the lighter parts
of his subjects want brilliancy. What he does "en petit," is better than
what he does upon a larger scale." In <EM>mezzotint</EM> the Parisians
have not a single artist particularly deserving of commendation. They are
perhaps as indifferent as we are somewhat too extravagantly attached, to
it. Speaking of the FRENCH SCHOOL OF ENGRAVING, in a general and summary
manner--especially of the line engravers--one must admit that there is a
great variety of talent; combined with equal knowledge of drawing and of
execution; but the general effect is too frequently hard, glittering, and
metallic. The draperies have sometimes the severity of armour; and the
accessories, of furniture or other objects, are frequently too highly and
elaborately finished. Nor is the flesh always free from the appearance of
marble. But the names I have mentioned, although not entirely without some
of these defects, have great and more than counter-balancing
excellences.</P>

<P>In the midst of all the graphic splendour of modern Paris, it was
delightful music to my ears to hear WILKIE and RAIMBACH so highly extolled
by M. Bénard. "Ha, votre <EM>Wilkie</EM>--voilà un génie distingué!" Who
could say "nay?" But let BURNET have his share of graphic praise; for the
<EM>Blind Fiddler</EM> owes its popularity throughout Europe to
<EM>his</EM> burin. They have recently copied our friend Wilkie's
productions on a small scale, in aqua-tint; cleverly enough--for three
francs a piece. I told Benard that the Duke of Wellington had recently
bespoke a picture from Mr. Wilkie's pencil. "What is the subject to
be?"--demanded he, quickly. I replied, in the very simplicity of my heart,
"Soldiers regaling themselves, on receiving the news of the victory of
Waterloo." Mons. Bénard was paralised for one little moment: but rallying
quickly, he answered, with perfect truth, as I conceive "<EM>Comment
donc</EM>, TOUT EST WATERLOO, <EM>chez vous!</EM>" M. Bénard spoke very
naturally, and I will not find fault with him for such a response; for he
is an obliging, knowing, and a very pleasant tradesman to do business
with. He admits, readily and warmly, that we have great artists, both as
painters and engravers; and pointing to Sharpe's <EM>John Hunter</EM> and
<EM>The Doctors of the Church</EM>--which happened to be hanging just
before us--he observed that "these, efforts had never been surpassed by
his own countrymen." I told him (while conversing about the respective
merits of the British and French Schools of Engraving) that it appeared to
me, that in France, there was no fine feeling for LANDSCAPE ENGRAVING; and
that, as to ANTIQUARIAN art, what had been produced in the publications of
Mr. Britton, and in the two fine topographical works--Mr. Clutterbuck's
Hertfordshire," and. Mr. Surtees' Durham--exhibited such specimens of the
burin, in that department, as could scarcely be hoped to be excelled.<A
name="fnref_197"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_197">197</A> M. Bénard did
not very strenuously combat these observations. The great mart for
<EM>Printselling</EM> is the Boulevards; and more especially that of the
<EM>Boulevards Italiens</EM>. A stranger can have no conception of the
gaiety and brilliance of the print-shops, and print-stalls, in this
neighbourhood. Let him first visit it in the morning about nine o'clock;
with the sun-beams sparkling among the foliage of the trees, and the
incessant movements of the populace below, who are about commencing
another day's pilgrimage of human life. A pleasant air is stirring at this
time; and the freshness arising from the watering of the footpath--but
more particularly the fragrance from innumerable bouquets, with
mignonette, rose trees, and lilacs--extended in fair array--is altogether
quite charming and singularly characteristic. But my present business is
with prints. You see them, hanging in the open air--framed and not
framed--for some quarter of a mile: with the intermediate space filled by
piles of calf-bound volumes and sets of apparently countless folios. Here
are <EM>Moreri, Bayle</EM>, the <EM>Dictionnaire de Trévoux,
Charpentier</EM>, and the interminable <EM>Encyclopédie</EM>: all very
tempting of their kind, and in price:--but all utterly unpurchasable--on
account of the heavy duties of importation, arising from their weight.</P>

<P>However--again I say--my present business is with <EM>Prints</EM>.
Generally speaking, these prints are pleasing in their manner of
execution, reasonable in price, and of endless variety. But the perpetual
intrusion of subjects of studied nudity is really at times quite
disgusting. It is surprising (as I think I before remarked to you) with
what utter indifference and apathy, even females, of respectable
appearance and dress, will be gazing upon these subjects; and now that the
art of <EM>lithography</EM> is become fashionable, the print-shops of
Paris will be deluged with an inundation of these odious representations,
which threaten equally to debase the art and to corrupt morals. This cheap
and wholesale circulation of what is mischievous, and of really most
miserable execution, is much to be deplored. Even in the better part of
art, lithography will have a pernicious effect. Not only a well-educated
and distinguished engraver will find, in the long run his business
slackening from the reduced prices at which prints. are sold, but a
<EM>bad taste</EM> will necessarily be the result: for the generality of
purchasers, not caring for comparative excellence in art, will be well
pleased to give <EM>one</EM> franc, for what, before, they could not
obtain under <EM>three</EM> or <EM>five</EM>. Hence we may date the
decline and downfall of art itself. I was surprised, the other day, at
hearing DENON talk so strongly in favour of lithography. I told him "it
was a bastard art; and I rejoiced, in common with every man of taste or
feeling, that <EM>that</EM> art had not made its appearance before the
publication of his work upon Egypt." It may do well for</P>

<P>"The whisker'd pandour and the fierce hussar"--</P>

<P>or it may, in the hands of such a clever artist as VERNET, be managed
with good effect in representations of skirmishes of horse and
foot--groups of banditti--a ruined battlement, or mouldering
tower--overhanging rocks--rushing torrents--or umbrageous trees--but, in
the higher department of art, as connected with portrait and historical
engraving, it cannot, I apprehend, attain to any marked excellence.<A
name="fnref_198"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_198">198</A> Portraits
however--of a particular description--<EM>may</EM> be treated with
tolerable success; but when you come to put lithographic engraving in

necessarily be</P>

<P>I cannot take leave of A CITY, in which I have tarried so long, and
with so much advantage to myself, without saying one word about the
manners, customs, and little peculiarities of character of those with whom
I have been recently associating. Yet the national character is pretty
nearly the same at Rouen and at Caen, as at Paris; except that you do not
meet with those insults from the <EM>canaille</EM> which are but too
frequent at these first-mentioned places. Every body here is busy and
active, yet very few. have any thing <EM>to do</EM>--in the way of what an
Englishman would call <EM>business</EM>. The thoughtful brow, the
abstracted, look, the hurried step.. which you see along Cheapside and
Cornhill ... are here of comparatively rare appearance. Yet every body is
"sur le pavé." Every body seems to live out of doors. How the
<EM>ménage</EM> goes on--and: how domestic education is regulated--strikes
the inexperienced eye of an Englishman as a thing quite inconceivable. The
temperature of Paris is no doubt very fine, although it has been of late
unprecedentedly hot; and a French workman, or labourer, enjoys, out of
doors--from morning till night those meals, which, with us, are usually
partaken of within. The public places of entertainment are pretty sure to
receive a prodigious proportion of the population of Paris every evening.
A mechanic, or artisan, will devote two thirds of his daily gains to the
participation of this pleasure. His dinner will consist of the most meagre
fare--at the lowest possible price--provided, in the evening, he can hear
<EM>Talma</EM> declaim, <EM>or Albert</EM> warble, or see <EM>Pol</EM>
leap, or <EM>Bigotini</EM> entrance a wondering audience by the grace of
her movements, and the pathos of her dumb shew, in <EM>Nina.</EM></P>

<P>The preceding strikes me as the general complexion of character of
three fourths of the Parisians: but then they are gay, and cheerful, and
apparently happy. If they have not the phlegm of the German, or the
thoughtfulness of ourselves, they are less cold, and less insensible to
the passing occurrences of life. A little pleases them, and they give in
return much more than they receive. One thing, however, cannot fail to
strike and surprise an attentive observer of national character. With all
their quickness, enthusiasm, and activity, the mass of French people want
that admirable quality which I unfeignedly think is the particular
characteristic of ourselves:--I mean, <EM>common sense</EM>. In the midst
of their architectural splendor--while their rooms are refulgent with
gilding and plate-glass; while their mantle-pieces sparkle with or-molu
clocks; or their tables are decorated with vases, and artificial flowers
of the most exquisite workmanship--and while their carpets and curtains
betray occasionally all the voluptuousness of eastern pomp ... you can
scarcely obtain egress or ingress into the respective apartments, from the
wretchedness of their <EM>locks</EM> and <EM>keys!</EM> Mechanical studies
or improvements should seem to be almost entirely uncultivated--for those
who remember France nearly half a century ago, tell me that it was pretty
much then as it is now. Another thing discomposes the sensitive nerves of
the English; especially those of our notable housewives. I allude to the
rubbishing appearance of their <EM>grates</EM>--and the dingy and
sometimes disgusting aspect of carpets and flowered furniture. A good
mahogany dining table is a perfect rarity<A name="fnref_199"></A><A class=
"fnref" href="#fn_199">199</A>--and let him, who stands upon a chair to
take down a quarto or octavo, beware how he encounter a broken shin or
bruised elbow, from the perpendicularity of the legs of that same
chair.</P>

<P>The same want of common-sense, cleanliness, and convenience--is visible
in nearly the whole of the French ménage. Again, in the streets--their
cabriolet drivers and hackney coachmen are sometimes the most furious of
their tribe. I rescued, the other day, an old and respectable
gentleman--with the cross of St. Louis appendant to his button-hole--from
a situation, in which, but for such a rescue, he must have been absolutely
knocked down and rode over. He shook his cane at the offender; and,
thanking me very heartily for my protection, observed, "these rascals
improve daily in their studied insult of all good Frenchmen." The want of
<EM>trottoirs</EM> is a serious and even absurd want; as it might be so
readily supplied. Their carts are obviously ill-constructed, and
especially in the caps of the wheels; which, in a narrow street--as those
of Paris usually are--unnecessarily occupy a <EM>foot</EM> of room, where
scarcely an <EM>inch</EM> can be spared. The rubbish piled against the
posts, in different parts of the street, is as disgusting as it is
obviously inconvenient. A police "ordonnance" would obviate all this in
twenty-four hours.</P>

<P>Yet in many important respects the Parisian multitude read a lesson to
ourselves. In their public places of resort, the French are wonderfully
decorous; and along the streets, no lady is insulted by the impudence of
either sex. You are sure to walk in peace, if you conduct yourself
peaceably. I had intended to say a word upon morals: and religion; but the
subject, while it is of the highest moment, is beyond the reach of a
traveller whose stay is necessarily short, and whose occupations, upon the
whole, have been confined rather among the dead than the living.</P>

<P>Farewell, therefore, to PARIS. I have purchased a very commodious
travelling carriage; to which a pair of post-horses will be attached in a
couple of days--and then, for upwards of three hundred miles of
journey-towards STRASBOURG! No schoolboy ever longed for a holiday more
ardently than I do for the relaxation which this journey will afford me. A
thousand hearty farewells!</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XII.</H3>

<P>PARIS TO STRASBOURG.</P>

<P><EM>Hotel de l'Esprit, Strasbourg, July</EM> 20, 1818.</P>

<P>I can hardly describe to you the gratification I felt on quitting the
"trein-trein".of Paris for the long, and upon the whole interesting,
journey to the place whence I date this despatch. My love of rural sights,
and of rural enjoyments of almost every kind, has been only equalled by my
admiration of the stupendous Cathedral of this celebrated city. But not a
word about the city of Strasbourg itself, for the present. My description,
both of <EM>that</EM> and of its <EM>curiosities</EM>, will be properly
reserved for another letter; when I shall necessarily have had more
leisure and fitter opportunities for the execution of the task. On the
eleventh of this month, precisely at ten o'clock, the rattling of the
hoofs of two lusty post horses--together with the cracking of an
<EM>experimental</EM> flourish or two of the postilion's whip--were heard
in the court-yard of the Hôtel des Colonies. Nothing can exceed the
punctuality of the Poste Royale in the attendance of the horses at the
precise hour of ordering them. Travellers, and especially those from our
<EM>own</EM> country, are not <EM>quite</EM> so punctual in availing
themselves of this regularity; but if you keep the horses for the better
part of an hour before you start, you must pay something extra for your
tardiness. Of all people, the <EM>English</EM> are likely to receive the
most useful lesson from this wholesome regulation. By a quarter past ten,
Mr. Lewis and myself having mounted our voiture, and given the signal for
departure, received the "derniers adieux" of Madame the hostess, and of
the whole corps of attendants. On leaving the gates of the hotel, the
postilion put forth all his energies in sundry loud smackings of his whip;
and as we went at a cautious pace through the narrower streets, towards
the <EM>Barriers of St. Martin</EM>, I could not but think, with inward
satisfaction, that, on visiting and leaving a city, so renowned as Paris,
for the <EM>first</EM> time, I had gleaned more intellectual fruit than I
had presumed to hope for; and that I had made acquaintances which might
probably ripen into a long and steady friendship. In short, my own
memoranda, together with the drawings of Messrs. Lewis and Coeuré, were
results, which convinced me that my time had not been mispent, and that my
objects of research were not quite undeserving of being recorded. Few
reflections give one so much pleasure, on leaving, a city--where there are
so many thousand temptations to abuse time and to destroy character.</P>

<P>The day of our departure was very fine, tending rather to heat. In a
little half hour we cleared the barrier of St. Martin, and found ourselves
on the broad, open, route royale--bordered by poplars and limes. To the
right, was the pretty village of <EM>Belleville:</EM> to the left, at the
distance of some six or eight English miles, we observed <EM>Montmorenci,
St. Germain en Laye</EM>, and, considerably nearer, <EM>St. Denis</EM>.
All these places, together with <EM>Versailles,</EM> I had previously
visited--Montmorenci and St. Denis twice--and intended to have given you
an account of them; but you could have received from me scarcely any thing
more than what the pages of the commonest tour would have supplied you
with. We first changed horses at <EM>Bondy</EM>, the forest of which was
once very extensive and much celebrated. You now behold little more than a
formal avenue of trees. The <EM>Castle of Raincy</EM>, situated in this
forest, is to the right, well-wooded--and the property of the Duke of
Orleans. <EM>Ville-Parisis</EM> was the next prettiest spot, in our route
to <EM>Claye</EM>, where we again changed horses. The whole route, from
<EM>Ville-Parisis</EM> to <EM>Meaux</EM>, was exceedingly pleasing and
even picturesque. At Meaux we dined, and have reason to remember the
extravagant charges of the woman who kept the inn. The heat of the day was
now becoming rather intense. While our veal-cutlet was preparing, we
visited the church; which had frequently, and most picturesquely, peeped
out upon us during our route. It is a large, cathedral-like looking
church, without transepts, Only one tower (in the west front), is
built--with the evident intention of raising another in the same aspect.
They were repairing the west front, which is somewhat elaborately
ornamented; but so intensely hot was the sun--on our coming out to examine
it--that we were obliged to retreat into the interior, which seemed to
contain the atmosphere of a different climate. A tall, well-dressed,
elderly priest, in company with a middle-aged lady, were ascending the
front steps to attend divine service. Hot as it was, the priest saluted
us, and stood a half minute without his black cap--with the piercing rays
of the sun upon a bald head. The bell tolled softly, and there was a quiet
calm about the whole which almost invited, us to <EM>postpone</EM> our
attack upon the dinner we had ordered.</P>

<P>Ten francs for a miserable cutlet--and a yet more wretchedly-prepared
fricandeau--with half boiled artichokes, and a bottle of undrinkable vin
ordinaire--was a charge sufficiently monstrous to have excited the well
known warmth of expostulation of an English traveller--but it was really
too hot to talk aloud! The landlady pocketed my money, and I pocketed the
affront which so shameful a charge may be considered as having put upon
me. We now rolled leisurely on towards <EM>La Ferté-sous-Jouarre:</EM>
about five French-leagues from Meaux--not without stopping to change
horses at <EM>St. Jean,</EM> &amp;c. The heat would not even allow of the
exercise of the postilion's whip. Every body, and every thing seemed to be
oppressed by it. The labourer was stretched out in the shade, and the
husbandman slept within the porch of his cottage. We had no sooner entered
the little town of La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, and driven to the post-house,
when not fewer than four blacksmiths came rushing out of their respective
forges, to examine every part of the carriage. "A nail had started here: a
screw was wanting there: and a fracture had taken place in another
direction: even the perch was given way in the centre!" "Alas, for my
voiture de voyage!" exclaimed I to my companion. Meanwhile, a man came
forward with a red-hot piece of iron, in the shape of a cramp, to fix
round the perch--which hissed as the application was made. And all
this--before I could say wherefore! or even open my mouth to express
astonishment! They were absolutely about to take off the wheels of the
carriage; to examine, and to grease them--but it was then for the first
time, that I opened a well-directed fire of expostulation; from which I
apprehend that they discovered I was not perfectly ignorant either of
their language or of their trickery. However, the rogues had <EM>four</EM>
francs for what they had the impudence to ask <EM>six</EM>; and
considering my vehicle to be now proof against the probability of an
accident, I was resolved to leave the town in the same good humour in
which I had entered it.</P>

<P>On quitting, we mounted slowly up a high ascent, and saw from thence
the village of <EM>Jouarre</EM>, on a neighbouring summit, smothered with
trees. It seemed to consist of a collection of small and elegant country
houses, each with a lawn and an orchard. At the foot of the summit winds
the unostentatious little stream of <EM>Le Petit Morin</EM> The whole of
this scenery, including the village of <EM>Montreuil-aux-Lions</EM>--a
little onwards--was perfectly charming, and after the English fashion: and
as the sky became mellowed by the rays of the declining sun, the entire
landscape assumed a hue and character which absolutely refreshed our
spirits after the heat of the previous part of the journey. We had
resolved to sleep at <EM>Chateau-Thierry</EM>, about seven leagues off,
and the second posting-place from where we had last halted. Night was
coming on, and the moon rose slowly through a somewhat dense horizon, as
we approached our rendezvous for the evening. All was tranquil and sweet.
We drove to the inn called the <EM>Sirène</EM>, situated in the worst
possible part of the town: but we quickly changed our determination, and
bespoke beds for the night, and horses for the following morning, at the
<EM>Poste Royale</EM>. The landlady of the Inn was a tartar--of her
species. She knew how to talk civilly; and, for her, a more agreeable
occupation--how to charge! We had little rest, and less sleep. By a
quarter past five I was in the carriage; intending to breakfast at
<EM>Epernay</EM>, about twenty-five miles off.</P>

<P>The first post-station is <EM>Parois</EM>. It is a beautiful drive
thither, and the village itself is exceedingly picturesque. From
<EM>Parois</EM> to <EM>Dormans</EM>, the next post village, the road
continues equally interesting. We seemed to go each post like the wind;
and reached <EM>Epernay</EM> by nine o'clock. The drive from Dormans to
Epernay is charming; and as the sky got well nigh covered by soft fleecy
clouds when we reached the latter place, our physical strength, as well as
animal spirits, seemed benefited by the change. I was resolved to
<EM>bargain</EM> for every future meal at an inn: and at Epernay I bespoke
an excellent breakfast of fruit, eggs, coffee and tea, at three francs a
head. This town is the great place in France for the manufacture of
<EM>Vin de Champagne</EM>. It is here where they make it in the greatest
quantities; although <EM>Sillery</EM>, near Rheims, boasts of champagne of
a more delicate quality. I learnt here that the Prussians, in their
invasion of France in 1814, committed sad havoc with this tempting
property. They had been insulted, and even partially fired upon--as they
passed through the town,--and to revenge themselves, they broke open the
cellars of M ..., the principal wine merchant; and drank the contents of
only--<EM>one hundred thousand bottles of champagne</EM>!" "But," said the
owner of these cellars, (beyond the reach of the hearing of the Prussians,
as you may be well assured!) "they did not break open my <EM>largest
vault</EM> ... where I had <EM>half as much again!</EM>. "Indeed, I was
told that the wine vaults of Epernay were as well worth inspection, as the
catacombs of Paris.</P>

<P>I should observe to you that the river <EM>Marne</EM>, one of the
second- rate rivers, of France, accompanies you pretty closely all the way
from Chateau Thierry to Chalons--designated as <EM>Chalons-sur-Marne.</EM>
From Epernay to Chalons you pass through nothing but corn fields. It is a
wide and vast ocean of corn--with hardly a tree, excepting those
occasionally along the road, within a boundary of ten miles. Chalons is a
large and populous town; but the churches bear sad traces of revolutionary
fury. Some of the porches, once covered with a profusion of rich,
alto-relievo sculpture, are absolutely treated as if these ornaments had
been pared away to the very quick! Scarcely a vestige remains. It is in
this town where the two great roads to STRASBOURG--one by <EM>Metz</EM>,
and the other by <EM>Nancy</EM>--unite. The former is to the north, the
latter to the south. I chose the latter; intending to return to Paris by
the former. On leaving Chalons, we purposed halting to dine at
<EM>Vitry-sur-Marne</EM>--distant two posts, of about four leagues each.
<EM>La Chaussée,</EM> which we reached at a very smart trot, was the first
post town, and is about half way to Vitry. From thence we had "to mount a
huge hill"--- as the postilion told us; but it was here, as in
Normandy--these huge hills only provoked our laughter. However, the wheel
was subjected to the drag-chain--and midst clouds of white dust, which
converted us into millers, we were compelled to descend slowly. Vitry was
seen in the distance, which only excited our appetite and made us anxious
to increase our pace.</P>

<P>On reaching Vitry, I made my terms for dinner with the landlady of the
principal inn--who was literally as sharp as a razor. However, we had a
comfortable room, a good plain dinner, with an excellent bottle of <EM>Vin
de Beaune</EM>, for three francs each. "Could Monsieur refuse this
trifling payment?" He could not. Before dinner I strolled to the principal
church--which is indeed a structure of a most noble appearance--like that
of St. Sulpice in form, and perhaps of a little more than half its size.
It is the largest parish church which I have yet seen; but it is
comparatively modern. It was Sunday; and a pleasing spectacle presented
itself on entering. A numerous group of young women, dressed almost
entirely in white, with white caps and veils, were singing a sort of
evening hymn--which I understood to be called the <EM>Chaplet of the
Virgin</EM>. Their voices, unaccompanied by instrumental music, sounded
sweetly from the loftiness of the roof; and every singer seemed to be
touched with the deepest sense of devotion. They sang in an attitude with
the body leaning forward, and the head gently inclined. The silence of the
place--its distance from the metropolis--the grey aspect of the
heavens--and the advanced hour of the day ... all contributed to produce
in our minds very pleasing and yet serious sensations. I shall not easily
forget the hymn called THE CHAPLET OF THE VIRGIN, as it was sung in the
church of Vitry.</P>

<P>After leaving this place we successively changed horses at
<EM>Longchamp</EM> and at <EM>St. Dizier</EM>. To our great comfort, it
began to threaten rain. While the horses were being changed at the former
place, I sat down upon a rough piece of stone, in the high road, by the
side of a well dressed paysanne, and asked her if she remembered the
retreat of Bonaparte in the campaign of 1814--and whether he had passed
there? She said she remembered it well. Bonaparte was on horseback, a
little in advance of his troops--and ambled gently, within six paces of
where we were sitting. His head was rather inclined, and he appeared to be
very thoughtful. <EM>St. Dizier</EM> was the memorable place upon which
Bonaparte made a rapid retrograde march, in order to get into the rear of
the allied troops, and thus possess himself of their supplies. But this
desperate movement, you know, cost him his capital, and eventually his
empire. St. Dizier is rather a large place, and the houses are almost
uniformly white. Night and rain came on together as we halted to change
horses. But we were resolved upon another stage--to <EM>Saudrupt</EM>: and
were now about entering the department of LORRAINE.</P>

<P>The moon struggled through a murky sky, after the cessation of rain, as
we entered <EM>Saudrupt</EM>: which is little better than a miserable
village. Travellers seldom or never sleep here; but we had gone a very
considerable distance since five in the morning, and were glad of any
thing in the shape of beds. Not an inn in Normandy which we had visited,
either by day or by night, seemed to be more sorry and wretched than this,
where we--stretched our limbs, rather than partook of slumber. At one in
the morning, a young and ardent lover chose to serenade his mistress, who
was in the next house, with a screaming tune upon a half-cracked
violin--which, added to the never-ceasing smacking of whips of farmers,
going to the next market town--completed our state of restlessness and
misery. Yet, the next morning, we had a breakfast ... so choice, so clean,
and so refreshing--in a place of all others the least apparently likely to
afford it--that we almost fancied our strength had been recruited by a
good night's sleep. The landlord could not help his miserable mansion, for
he was very poor: so I paid him cheerfully and liberally for the
accommodation he was capable of affording, and at nine o'clock left
Saudrupt in the hope of a late dinner at NANCY--the capital of
Lorraine.</P>

<P>The morning was fresh and fair. In the immediate neighbourhood of
Saudrupt is the pretty village of <EM>Brillon</EM>, where I noticed some
stone crosses; and where I observed that particular species of domestic
architecture, which, commencing almost at Longchamps, obtains till within
nearly three stages of Strasbourg. It consists in having rather low or
flat roofs, in the Italian manner, with all the beams projecting
<EM>outside</EM> of the walls: which gives it a very unfinished and
barbarous look. And here too I began to be more and more surprised at the
meagreness of the population of the <EM>country</EM>. Even on quitting
Epernay, I had noticed it to my companion. The human beings you see, are
chiefly females--ill-featured, and ill complexioned--working hard beneath
the rays of a scorching sun. As to that sabbath-attire of cleanliness,
even to smartness among our <EM>own</EM> country people, it is a thing
very rarely to be seen in the villages of France. At Brillon, we bought
fine cherries, of a countrywoman for two sous the pound.</P>

<P><EM>Bar-le Duc</EM> is the next post-town. It is a place of
considerable extent and population: and is divided into the upper and
lower town. The approach to it, along hilly passes, covered with
vineyards, is pleasant enough. The driver wished to take us to the upper
town--to see the church of St. Peter, wherein is contained "a skeleton
perforated with worm-holes, which was the admiration of the best
connoisseurs." We civilly declined such a sight, but had no objection to
visit the church. It was a Saint's day: and the interior of the church was
crowded to excess by women and lads. An old priest was giving his
admonition from the high altar, with great propriety and effect: but we
could not stay 'till the conclusion of the service. The carriage was at
the door; and, reascending, we drove to the lower town, down a somewhat
fearful descent, to change horses. It was impossible to avoid noticing the
prodigious quantity of fruit--especially of currants and strawberries.
<EM>Ligny</EM> was our next halting place, to change horses. The route
thither was sufficiently pleasant. You leave the town through rather a
consequential gateway, of chaste Tuscan architecture, and commence
ascending a lofty hill. From hence you observe, to the left, an old castle
in the outskirts of the town. The road is here broad and grand: and
although a very lively breeze was playing in our faces, yet we were not
insensible to the increasing heat of the day. We dined at <EM>St.
Aubin</EM>. A hearty good-humoured landlady placed before us a very
comfortable meal, with a bottle of rather highly-flavoured vin ordinaire.
The inn was little better than a common ale house in England: but every
thing was "très propre." On leaving, we seemed to be approaching high
hills, through flat meadows--where very poor cattle were feeding. A pretty
drive towards <EM>Void</EM> and <EM>Laye</EM>, the next post-towns: but it
was still prettier on approaching <EM>Toul</EM>, of which the church, at a
distance, had rather a cathedral-like appearance. We drank tea at
Toul--but first proceeded to the church, which we found to be greatly
superior to that of Meaux. Its interior is indeed, in parts, very elegant:
and one lancet-shaped window, in particular, of stained glass, may even
vie with much of what the cathedral of this place affords.</P>

<P>At Toul, for the first time since quitting Paris, we were asked for our
passports; it being a fortified town. Our next stage was
<EM>Dommartin</EM>; behind which appeared to be a fine hilly country, now
purpled by the rays of a declining sun. The church of Toul, in our rear,
assumed a more picturesque appearance than before. At <EM>Velaine</EM>,
the following post-town, we had a pair of fine mettlesome Prussian horses
harnessed to our voiture, and started at a full swing trot--through the
forest of Hayes, about a French league in length. The shade and coolness
of this drive, as the sun was getting low, were quite refreshing. The very
postilion seemed to enjoy it, and awakened the echoes of each avenue by
the unintermitting sounds of numberless flourishes of his whip. "How
tranquil and how grand!" would he occasionally exclaim. On clearing the
forest, we obtained the first glimpse of something like a distant
mountainous country: which led us to conclude that we were beginning to
approach the VOSGES--or the great chain of mountains, which, running
almost due north and south, separates France from ALSACE. Below, glittered
the spires of <EM>Nancy</EM>--as the sun's last rays rested upon them. A
little distance beyond, shot up the two elegant towers of <EM>St.
Nicholas</EM>; but I am getting on a little too fast.... The forest of
Hayes can be scarcely less than a dozen English miles in breadth. I had
never before seen so much wood in France. Yet the want of water is a great
draw-back to the perfection of rural scenery in this country. We had
hardly observed one rivulet since we had quitted the little glimmering
stream at Chateau-Thierry.</P>

<P>We now gained fast upon NANCY, the capital of Lorraine. It is doubtless
among the handsomest provincial towns in Europe; and is chiefly indebted
for its magnificence to Stanislaus, King of Poland, who spent the latter
part of his life there, and whose daughter was married to Louis XV. The
annexation of Lorraine to France has been considered the masterpiece of
Louis's policy. Nancy may well boast of her broad and long streets:
running chiefly at right angles with each other: well paved, and tolerably
clean. The houses are built chiefly of stone. Here are churches, a
theatre, a college, a public library--palace-like buildings--public
gardens--hospitals, coffee houses, and barracks. In short, Nancy is
another Caen; but more magnificent, although less fruitful in antiquities.
The <EM>Place de la Liberté</EM> et <EM>d'alliance</EM> et <EM>de la
Carriére</EM> may vie with the public buildings of Bath; but some of the
sculptured ornaments of the <EM>former</EM>, exhibit miserable proofs of
the fury of the Revolutionists. Indeed Nancy was particularly
distinguished by a visit of the Marseillois gentry, who chose to leave
behind pretty strong proofs of their detestation of what was at once
elegant and harmless. The headless busts of men and women, round the house
of the governor, yet prove the excesses of the mob; and the destruction of
two places of worship was the close of their devastating labours.</P>

<P>Nancy is divided into the <EM>Old</EM> and the <EM>New Town</EM>. The
four principal streets, dividing the latter nearly at right angles, are
terminated by handsome arches, in the character of <EM>gateways</EM>. They
have a noble appearance.</P>

<P>On the first evening of our arrival at Nancy, we walked, after a late
cup of tea, into the public garden--at the extremity of the town. It was
broad moon light; and the appearance of the <EM>Caffés</EM>, and several
<EM>Places</EM>, had quite a new and imposing effect; they being somewhat
after the Parisian fashion. After a day of dust, heat, and rapid motion, a
seat upon one of the stone-benches of the garden--surrounded by dark green
trees, of which the tops were tipt with silver by the moon beam--could not
fail to refresh and delight me: especially as the tranquillity of the
place was only disturbed by the sounds of two or three groups of
<EM>bourgeoises</EM>, strolling arm in arm, and singing what seemed to be
a popular, national air--of which the tune was somewhat psalm-like. The
broad walks abounded with bowers, and open seats; and the general effect
was at once singular and pleasing. The Hotel-Royal is an excellent inn;
and the owners of it are very civil people.</P>

<P>My first visits were paid to churches and to bookseller's shops. Of
churches, the <EM>Cathedral</EM> is necessarily the principal. It is
large, lofty, and of an elegant construction, of the Grecian order:
finished during the time of Stanislaus. The ornamental parts are too
flaunting; too profuse, and in bad taste. This excess of decoration
pervades also the house of the Governor; which, were it not so, might vie
with that of Lord Burlington; which it is not unlike in its general
appearance. In the Cathedral, the monument of Stanislaus, by Girardon, is
<EM>considered</EM> to be a chef-d'ouvre. There was a Girardet--chief
painter to Stanislaus, who is here called "the rival of Apelles:" a rival
with a vengeance! From thence I went to an old church--perhaps of the
thirteenth, but certainly of the fourteenth century. They call it, I
think, <EM>St. Epreuve.</EM> In this church I was much struck with a
curious old painting, executed in distemper, upon the walls of a side
aisle, which seemed to be at least three hundred years old. It displayed
the perils and afflictions of various Saints, on various emergencies, and
how they were all eventually saved by the interposition of the Virgin. A
fine swaggering figure, in the foreground, dressed out in black and
yellow-striped hose, much delighted me. Parts of this curious old picture
were worth copying. Near to this curiosity seemed to be a fine, genuine
painting, by Vandyke, of the Virgin and Child--the first exhibition of the
kind which I had seen since leaving Paris. It formed a singular contrast
to the picture before described. On quitting this old church, I could not
help smiling to observe a bunch of flowers, in an old mustard pot--on
which was inscribed "<EM>Moutarde Fine de Nageon, à Dijon</EM>--" placed
at the feet of a statue of the Virgin as a sacred deposit!</P>

<P>On leaving the church, I visited two booksellers: one of them rather
distinguished for his collection of <EM>Alduses</EM>--as I was informed. I
found him very chatty, very civil, but not very reasonable in his prices.
He told me that he had plenty of old books--<EM>Alduses</EM> and
<EM>Elzevirs, &amp;c</EM>.--with lapping-over vellum-bindings. I desired
nothing better; and followed him up stairs. Drawer after drawer was pulled
out. These M. Renouard had seen: those the Comte d'Ourches had wished to
purchase; and a third pile was destined for some nobleman in the
neighbourhood. There was absolutely nothing in the shape of
temptation--except a <EM>Greek Herodian</EM>, by Theodore Martin of
Louvain, and a droll and rather rare little duodecimo volume, printed at
Amsterdam in 1658, entitled <EM>La Comédie de Proverbes</EM>. The next
bookseller I visited, was a printer. "Had he any thing old and curious?"
He replied, with a sort of triumphant chuckle, that he "once had
<EM>such</EM> a treasure of this kind!" "What might it have been?" "A
superb missal--for which a goldsmith had offered him twelve sous for each
initial letter upon a gold ground--but which he had parted with, for 100
francs, to the library of a Benedictin monastery--now destroyed. It had
cost him twelve sous." "But see, Sir, (continued he) is not this curious?"
"It is a mere reprint, (replied I) of what was first published three
hundred years ago." "No matter--buy it, and read it--it will amuse
you--and it costs only five sous." I purchased two copies, and I send you
here the title and the frontispiece. "<EM>Le Dragon Rouge, ou l'art de
commander les Esprits Célestes, Aériens, Terrestres, Infernaux. Avec le
vrai Secret de faire parler les Morts; de gagner toutes les fois qu'on met
aux Lotteries; de découvrir les Trésors," &amp;c</EM>.</P>

<DIV class="figcenter"  style="width:50%;"><IMG width="100%"
src="images/372.png" alt=
"Le Dragon Rouge"></DIV>

<P>The bookseller told me that he regularly sold hundreds of copies of
this work, and that the country people yet believed in the efficacy of its
contents! I had been told that it was in this very town that a copy of
<EM>the Mazarine Bible</EM> had been picked up for some <EM>half</EM>
<EM>dozen francs!</EM>--and conveyed to the public library at Munich.</P>

<P>Towards the evening, I visited the public library by appointment.
Indeed I had casually met the public librarian at the first Bouquiniste's:
and he fixed the hour of half-past six. I was punctual almost to the
minute; and on entering the library, found a sort of BODLEY in miniature:
except that there was a great mass of books in the middle of the
room--placed in a parallelogram form--which I thought must have a
prodigiously heavy pressure upon the floor. I quickly began to look about
for <EM>Editiones Principes</EM>; but, at starting, my guide placed before
me two copies of the celebrated <EM>Liber Nanceidos</EM>:<A name=
"fnref_200"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_200">200</A> of which
<EM>one</EM> might be fairly said to be <EM>large paper</EM>. On
continuing my examination, I found civil and canon law--pandects, glosses,
decretals, and commentaries--out of number: together with no small
sprinkling of medical works. Among the latter was a curious, and
<EM>Mentelin</EM>-like looking, edition of <EM>Avicenna</EM>. But
<EM>Ludolphus's Life of Christ</EM>, in Latin, printed in the smallest
type of <EM>Eggesteyn</EM>, in 1474, a folio, was a volume really worth
opening and worth coveting. It was in its original monastic
binding--large, white, unsullied, and abounding with rough marginal
edges.</P>

<P>It is supposed that the library contains 25,000 volumes. Attached to it
is a Museum of Natural History. But alas! since the revolution it exhibits
a frightful picture of decay, devastation, and confusion. To my eye, it
was little better than the apothecary's shop described by Romeo. It
contained a number of portraits in oil, of eminent Naturalists; which are
palpable copies, by the same hand, of originals ... that have probably
perished. The museum had been gutted of almost every thing that was
curious or precious. Indeed they want funds, both for the museum and the
library. It was near night-fall when I quitted the library, and walked
with the librarian in a pleasant, open space, near one of the chief gates
or entrances before mentioned. The evening was uncommonly sweet and
serene: and the moon, now nearly full, rose with more than her usual
lustre ... in a sky of the deepest blue which I had yet witnessed. I shall
not readily forget the conversation of that walk. My companion spoke of
his own country with the sincerity of a patriot, but with the good sense
of an honest, observing, reflecting man. I had never listened to
observations better founded, or which seemed calculated to produce more
beneficial results. Of <EM>our</EM> country, he spoke with an animation
approaching to rapture. It is only the exercise of a grateful feeling to
record this--of a man--whose name I have forgotten, and whose person I may
never see again. On quitting each other, I proceeded somewhat
thoughtfully, to an avenue of shady trees, where groups of men and women
were sitting or strolling--beneath the broad moon beam--and chanting the
popular airs of their country.</P>

<P>The next morning I quitted Nancy. The first place of halting was
<EM>St. Nicholas</EM>--of which the elegant towers had struck us on the
other side of Nancy. It was no post town: but we could not pass such an
ecclesiastical edifice without examining it with attention. The village
itself is most miserable; yet it could once boast of a <EM>press</EM>
which gave birth to the <EM>Liber Nanceidos</EM>.<A name=
"fnref_201"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_201">201</A> The space before
the west front of the church is absolutely choked by houses of the most
squalid appearance--so that there is hardly getting a good general view of
the towers. The interior struck us as exceedingly interesting. There are
handsome transepts; in one of which is a large, circular, central pillar;
in the other, an equally large one, but twisted. One is astonished at
finding such a large and beautiful building in such a situation; but
formerly the place might have been large and flourishing. The west front
of this church may rival two-thirds of similar edifices in France.</P>

<P><EM>Domballe</EM> was the next post: the drive thither being somewhat
picturesque. <EM>Luneville</EM> is the immediately following post town. It
is a large and considerable place; looking however more picturesque at a
distance than on its near approach: owing to the red tiles of which the
roofs are composed. Here are handsome public buildings; a fountain, with
eight jets d'eau--barracks, a theatre, and the castle of Prince Charles,
of Lorraine. A good deal of business is carried on in the earthenware and
cotton trade--of both which there is a manufactory--together with that of
porcelaine. This place is known in modern history from the <EM>Treaty of
Luneville</EM> between the Austrians and French in 1801. From hence we
went to <EM>Bénaménil</EM>, the next stage; and in our way thither, we
saw, for the first time since leaving Paris, a <EM>flock of geese!</EM>
Dined at <EM>Blamont</EM>--the succeeding post town. While our cutlets
were preparing we strolled to the old castle, now in a state of
dilapidation. It is not spacious, but is a picturesque relic. Within the
exterior walls is a fine kitchen garden. From the top of what might have
been the donjon, we surveyed the surrounding country--at that moment
rendered hazy by an atmosphere of dense, heated, vapour. Indeed it was
uncommonly hot. Upon the whole, both the village and <EM>Castle of
Blamont</EM> merit at least the leisurely survey of an entire day.</P>

<P>On starting for <EM>Héming</EM>, the next post, we were much pleased by
the sight of a rich, verdant valley, fertilized by a meandering rivulet.
The village of <EM>Richeval</EM> had particular attractions; and the sight
of alternate woods and meadows seemed to mitigate the severity of the heat
of the day. At Héming we changed horses, opposite a large fountain where
cattle were coming to drink. The effect was very picturesque; but there
was no time for the pencil of Mr. Lewis to be exercised. In less than five
minutes we were off for <EM>Sarrebourg</EM>. Evening came on as we
approached it. Here I saw <EM>hops</EM> growing, for the first time; and
here, for the first time, I heard the <EM>German language</EM> spoken--and
observed much of the German character in the countenances of the
inhabitants. The postilion was a German, and could not speak one word of
French. However, he knew the art of driving--for we seemed to fly like the
wind towards <EM>Hommarting</EM>--which we reached in half an hour. It was
just two leagues from Sarrebourg. We stopped to change horses close to
what seemed to be a farm house; and as the animals were being "yoked to
the car," for another German Phaeton, I walked into a very large room,
which appeared to be a kitchen. Two long tables were covered with supper;
at each of which sat--as closely wedged as well could be--a great number
of work-people of both sexes, and of all ages. Huge dogs were moving
backwards and forwards, in the hope of receiving some charitable morsel;,
and before the fire, on a littered hearth, lay stretched out two
tremendous mastiffs. I walked with fear and trembling. The cooks were
carrying the evening meal; and the whole place afforded such an
<EM>interior</EM>--as Jan Steen would have viewed with rapture, and Wilkie
have been delighted to copy. Meanwhile the postilion's whip was sounded:
the fresh horses were neighing: and I was told that every thing was ready.
I mounted with alacrity. It was getting dark; and I requested the good
people of the house to tell the postilion that I did not wish him to
<EM>sleep</EM> upon the road.</P>

<P>The hint was sufficient. This second German postilion seemed to have
taken a leaf out of the book of his predecessor: for we exchanged a sharp
trot for a full swing canter--terminating in a gallop; and found ourselves
unexpectedly before the gates of <EM>Phalsbourg</EM>. Did you ever, my
dear friend, approach a fortified town by the doubtful light of a clouded
moon, towards eleven of the clock? A mysterious gloom envelopes every
thing. The drawbridge is up. The solitary centinel gives the pass-word
upon the ramparts; and every footstep, however slight, has its particular
echo. Judge then of the noise made by our heavy-hoofed coursers, as we
neared the drawbridge. "What want you there?" said a thundering voice, in
the French language, from within. "A night's lodging," replied I. "We are
English travellers, bound for Strasbourg." "You must wait till I speak
with the sub-mayor." "Be it so." We waited patiently; but heard a great
deal of parleying within the gates. I began to think we should be doomed
to retrace our course--when, after a delay of full twenty minutes, we
heard ... to our extreme satisfaction ... the creaking of the hinges (but
not as "harsh thunder") of the ponderous portals--which opened slowly and
stubbornly--and which was succeeded by the clanking of the huge chain, and
the letting down of the drawbridge. This latter rebounded slightly as it
reached its level: and I think I hear, at this moment, the hollow rumbling
noise of our horses' feet, as we passed over the deep yawning fosse below.
Our passports were now demanded. We surrendered them willingly, on the
assurance given of receiving them the following morning. The gates were
now closed behind us, and we entered the town in high glee. "You are a
good fellow," said I to the gatesman: come to me at the inn, to-morrow
morning, and you shall be thanked in the way you like best."</P>

<P>The landlord of the inn was not yet a-bed. As he heard our approach, he
called all his myrmidons about him--and bade us heartily welcome. He was a
good-looking, sleek, jolly-faced man: civilly spoken, with a ready
utterance, which seemed prepared to touch upon all kinds of topics. After
I had bespoken tea and beds, and as the boiling water was getting ready,
he began after the following fashion: "Hé bien Mons. Le Comte ... comment
vont les affaires en Angleterre? Et votre grand capitaine, le DUC DE
VELLINGTON, comment se porte il? Ma foi, à ce moment, il joue un beau
rôle." I answered that "matters were going on very well in England, and
that our great Captain was in perfectly good health." "Vous le connoissez
parfaitement bien, sans doute?"--was his next remark. I told him I could
not boast of that honour. "Neanmoins, (added he) il est connu par-tout." I
readily admitted the truth of this observation. Our dialogue concluded by
an assurance on his part, that we should find our beds excellent, our
breakfast on the morrow delicious--and he would order such a pair of
horses (although he strongly recommended <EM>four</EM>,) to be put to our
carriage, as should set all competition at defiance.</P>

<P>His prediction was verified in every particular. The beds were
excellent; the breakfast, consisting of coffee, eggs, fruit, and bread and
butter, (very superior to what is usually obtained in France) was
delicious; and the horses appeared to be perfect of their kind. The
reckoning was, to be sure, a little severe: but I considered this as the
payment or punishment of having received the title of <EM>Count</EM> ...
without contradiction. It fell on my ears as mere words of course; but it
shall not deceive me a second time. We started a little time after nine;
and on leaving the place I felt more than usual anxiety and curiosity to
catch the first glimpse of the top of <EM>Strasbourg Cathedral</EM>,--a
building, of which I had so long cherished even the most extravagant
notions. The next post town was <EM>Saverne</EM>; and our route thither
was in every respect the most delightful and gratifying of any, and even
of all the routes, collectively, which we had yet experienced. As you
approach it, you cross over a part of the famous chain of mountains which
divide OLD FRANCE from Germany, and which we thought we had seen from the
high ground on the other side of Nancy. The country so divided, was, and
is yet, called ALSACE: and the mountains, just mentioned, are called the
<EM>Vosges</EM>. They run almost due north and south: and form a
commanding feature of the landscape in every point of view. But for
Saverne. It lies, with its fine old castle, at the foot of the pass of
these mountains; but the descent to it--is glorious beyond all
anticipation!</P>

<P>It has been comparatively only of late years that this road, or pass,
has been completed. In former times, it was almost impassable. As the
descent is rapid and very considerable, the danger attending it is
obviated by the high road having been cut into a cork-screw-shape;<A name=
"fnref_202"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_202">202</A> which presents, at
every spiral turn (if I may so speak) something new, beautiful, and
interesting. You continue, descending, gazing on all sides. To the right,
suspended almost in the air--over a beetling, perpendicular, rocky
cliff--feathered half way up with nut and beech--stands, or rather nods,
an old castle in ruins. It seems to shake with every breeze that blows:
but there it stands--and has stood--for some four centuries: once the
terror of the vassal, and now ... the admiration of the traveller! The
castle was, to my eye, of all castles which I had seen, the most elevated
in its situation, and the most difficult of access. The clouds of heaven
seemed to be resting upon its battlements. But what do I see yonder? "Is
it the top of the spire of Strasbourg Cathedral?" "It <EM>is,</EM> Sir,"
replied the postilion. I pulled off my travelling cap, by way of doing
homage; and as I looked at my watch, to know the precise time, found it
was just ten o'clock. It was worth making a minute of. Yet, owing to the
hills before--or rather to those beyond, on the other side of the Rhine,
which are very much loftier--the first impression gives no idea of the
extraordinary height of the spire. We continued to descend, slowly and
cautiously, with <EM>Saverne</EM> before us in the bottom. To the left,
close to the road side, stands an obelisk: on which is fixed, hi gilt
letters, this emphatic inscription:</P>

<P><STRONG>ALSATIA.</STRONG></P>

<P>Every thing, on reaching the level road, bespoke a distinct national
character. It was clear that we had forsaken French costume, as well as
the French language, among the common people: so obvious is it, as has
been remarked to me by a Strasbourgeois, that "mountains, and not rivers,
are the natural boundaries of countries." The women wore large, flat,
straw hats, with a small rose at the bottom of a shallow crown; while
their throats were covered, sometimes up to the mouth, with black, silk
cravats. Their hair was platted, hanging down in two equal divisions. The
face appeared to be flat. The men wore shovel hats, of which the front
part projected to a considerable distance; and the perpetually recurring
response of "<EM>yaw yaw</EM>"--left it beyond all doubt that we had taken
leave of the language of "the polite nation." At length we reached
Saverne, and changed horses. This town is large and bustling, and is said
to contain upwards of four thousand inhabitants. We did not stop to
examine any of its wonders or its beauties; for we were becoming impatient
for Strasbourg. The next two intermediate post towns were
<EM>Wasselonne</EM> and <EM>Ittenheim</EM>--and thence to Strasbourg: the
three posts united being about ten leagues. From Ittenheim we darted along
yet more swiftly than before. The postilion, speaking in a germanised
French accent, told us, that "we were about to visit one of the most
famous cities in the world--and <EM>such</EM> a CATHEDRAL!" The immediate
approach to Strasbourg is flat and uninteresting; nor could I, in every
possible view of the tower of the cathedral, bring myself to suppose
it--what it is admitted to be--the <EM>loftiest ecclesiastical edifice in
the world</EM>!</P>

<P>The fortifications about Strasbourg are said to afford one of the
finest specimens of the skill of Vauban. They may do so; but they are very
flat, tame, and unpicturesque. We now neared the barriers: delivered our
passports; and darted under the first large brick arched way. A devious
paved route brought us to the second gate;--and thus we entered the town;
desiring the post-boy to drive to the <EM>Hôtel de l'Esprit</EM>. "You
judge wisely, Sir, (replied he) for there is no Hotel, either in France or
Germany, like it." So saying, he continued, without the least
intermission, to make circular flourishes with his whip--accompanied by
such ear-piercing sounds, as caused every inhabitant to gaze at us. I
entreated him to desist; but in vain. "The English always enter in this
manner," said he--and having reached the hotel, he gave <EM>one</EM>
super-eminent flourish--which threw him off his balance, and nearly
brought him to the ground. When I paid him, he pleaded hard for an
<EM>extra five sous</EM> for this concluding flourish!</P>

<P>I am now therefore safely and comfortably lodged in this spacious
hotel, by the side of the river <EM>Ill</EM>--of which it is pleasing to
catch the lingering breezes as they stray into my chamber. God bless
you.</P>

<HR>
<P>P.S. One thing I cannot help adding--perhaps hardly deserving of a
postscript. All the way from Paris to Strasbourg, I am persuaded that we
did not meet <EM>six</EM> travelling equipages. The lumbering diligence
and steady Poste Royale were almost the only vehicles in action besides
our own. Nor were <EM>villas</EM> or <EM>chateaux</EM> visible; such as,
in our own country, enliven the scene and put the traveller in
spirits.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XIII.</H3>

<P>STRASBOURG. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PROTESTANT RELIGION. THE CATHEDRAL.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.</P>

<P><EM>Hôtel de l'Esprit, July</EM> 26, 1818.</P>

<P>MY DEAR FRIEND;</P>

<P>It is Sunday; and scarcely half an hour ago, I heard, from a Lutheran
church on the other side of the water, what I call good, hearty, rational
psalm-singing: without fiddles or trombones or serpents. Thus, although
considerably further from home, I almost fancied myself in old England.
This letter will touch chiefly upon topics of an antiquarian cast, but of
which I venture to anticipate your approbation; because I have long known
your attachment to the history of ALSACE--and that you have Schoepflin's
admirable work<A name="fnref_203"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_203">203</A> upon that country almost at your finger's ends. The city
of Strasbourg encloses within its walls a population of about fifty
thousand souls. I suspect, however, that in former times its population
was more numerous. At this present moment there are about two hundred-and
fifty streets, great and small; including squares and alleys. The main
streets, upon the whole, are neither wide nor narrow; but to a stranger
they have a very singular appearance, from the windows being occasionally
covered, on the outside, with <EM>iron bars</EM>, arranged after divers
fashions. This gives them a very prison-like effect, and is far from being
ornamental. The glazing of the windows is also frequently very curious. In
general, the panes of glass are small, and circular, confined in leaden
casements. The number of houses in Strasbourg is estimated at three
thousand five hundred.</P>

<P>There are not fewer than forty-seven bridges in the interior of the
town. These cross the branches of the rivers <EM>Ill</EM> and
<EM>Bruche</EM>--which empty themselves into the <EM>Rhine</EM>. The
fortifications of Strasbourg are equally strong and extensive; but they
assumed formerly a more picturesque, if not a more powerful aspect.<A
name="fnref_204"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_204">204</A></P>

<P>There are <EM>seven parishes</EM>; of which four are catholic, and
three protestant. This brings me to lay before you a brief outline of the
rise and progress of PROTESTANTISM in this place. Yet, as a preliminary
remark, and as connected with our mutual antiquarian pursuits, you are to
know that, besides parish churches, there were formerly <EM>fourteen
convents</EM>, exclusively of chapelries. All these are minutely detailed
in the recent work of M. Hermann,<A name="fnref_205"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_205">205</A> from which indeed I have gleaned the chief of the
foregoing particulars. A great many of these convents were suppressed in
the sixteenth century, upon the establishment of the protestant
religion.</P>

<P>But for a brief outline of the rise and progress of this establishment.
It must indeed be brief; but if so, it shall at least be clear and
faithful. The forerunner of Luther (in my opinion) was JOHN GEYLER; a man
of singular intrepidity of head and heart. He was a very extraordinary
genius, unquestionably; and the works which he has bequeathed to posterity
evince the variety of his attainments. Geyler preached boldly in the
cathedral against the lax manners and doubtful morality of the clergy. He
exhorted the magistrates to do their duty, and predicted that there must
be an alteration of religious worship ere the general morals of the
community could be amended. They preserve a stone chair or pulpit, of very
curious workmanship, but which had nearly been destroyed during the
Revolution, in which Geyler used to deliver his lectures. He died in 1510;
and within a dozen years after his death the doctrines of LUTHER, were
sedulously inculcated. The ground had been well prepared for such seed.
The court of Rome looked on with uneasiness; and the Pope sent a legate to
Strasbourg in 1522, to vent his anathemas, and to raise a strong party
against the growth of this new heresy--as it was called. At this time, the
reformed doctrine was even taught in the cathedral; and, a more remarkable
thing to strike the common people, the RECTOR of the church of St. Thomas
(the second religious establishment of importance, after that of the
cathedral) VENTURED TO MARRY! He was applauded both by the common people
and by many of the more respectable families. His example was followed:
and the religious of both sexes were allowed to leave their
establishments, to go where they would, and to enter upon the married
state. In 1530 the mass was generally abolished: and the protestant
religion was constantly exercised in the cathedral.</P>

<P>The spirit both of Geyler and of Luther might have rejoiced to find, in
1550, the chapter of St. Thomas resolutely avowing its determination to
perform the protestant--and nothing but the protestant--religion within
its own extensive establishment. The flame of the new religion seemed now
to have reached all quarters, and warmed all hearts. But a temporary check
to its progress was given by the cautious policy of Charles V. That wary
and heartless monarch (who had even less religion than he had of the
ordinary feelings of humanity) interfered with the weight of his power,
and the denunciations of his vengeance. Yet he found it necessary neither
wholly to suppress, nor wholly to check, the progress of the protestant
religion: while, on the other hand, the Strasbourgeois dreaded too much
the effects of his power to dispute his will by any compact or alliance of
opposition. In 1550, therefore, the matter stood thus. The cathedral, and
the collegiate and parish churches of St. Peter the Elder and St. Peter
the Younger, as well as the Oratory of all Saints, adopted the
<EM>catholic</EM> form of worship. The other parish churches adopted that
of the <EM>protestant</EM>. Yet in 1559 there happened such a serious
affray in the cathedral church itself--between the Catholics and
Protestants--as taught the former the obvious necessity of conceding as
much as possible to the latter. It followed, that, towards the end of the
same century, there were, in the cathedral chapter, <EM>seventeen
protestant</EM>, and <EM>eight catholic</EM> canons. Among the
<EM>latter</EM>, however, was the celebrated Cardinal de Lorraine:--one of
the most powerful, the most furious, and the most implacable of the
enemies of Protestantism. The part he took in the massacre of St.
Bartholomew's day, consigns his name to everlasting ignominy and
detestation.</P>

<P>In 1610 a league was formed for the adjustment of the differences
between the Catholics and Protestants: but the unfortunate thirty years
war breaking out in 1618, and desolating nearly the whole of Germany,
prevented the permanent consolidation of the interests of either party.
All this time Strasbourg was under the power, as it even now speaks the
language, and partakes of the customs and manners, of GERMANY: but its
very situation rendered it the prey of both the contending powers of
Germany and France. At length came the memorable, and as I suspect
treacherous, surrender of Strasbourg to the arms of Louis XIV, in
September 1681; when the respective rights and privileges of the Catholics
and Protestants were placed upon a definite footing: although, before this
event, the latter had considerably the ascendancy. These rights were
endeavoured to be shaken by the revocation of the edict of Nantes in
1685--not however before the Jesuits had been striving to warp the
feelings of the latter in favour of the former. The catholic religion was,
by the articles of the surrender of the city, established in the
cathedral, in the subordinate churches of St. Peter the Elder and St.
Peter the Younger, and in the Oratory of All Saints: and it has continued
to be exercised pretty much in the same proportion unto this day. The
majority of the inhabitants are however decidedly Protestants. Such is a
succinct, but I believe not unfaithful, account of the establishment of
the PROTESTANT RELIGION at Strasbourg.</P>

<P>This subject therefore naturally brings me to notice the principal
<EM>Temple of Worship</EM> in which the rites of either religion seem, for
a long time, to have been alternately exercised; and this temple can be no
other than <EM>the Minster</EM>--or, as we should say, the
<EM>Cathedral.</EM> Ere I assume the office of the historian, let me
gratify my inclinations as a spectator. Let me walk round this stupendous
structure. At this moment, therefore, consider me as standing in full gaze
before its west front--from which the tower springs. This tower seems to
reach to heaven. Indeed the whole front quite overwhelms you with
alternate emotions of wonder and delight. Luckily there is some little
space before it, in which trees have been recently planted; and where (as
I understand) the fruit and vegetable market is held. At the further end
of this space in approaching the Cathedral, and in running the eye over
the whole front, the first thing that strikes you is, the red or copperas
colour of the stone--which I presume to be a species of sand stone. This
gives a sort of severe metallic effect. However you are riveted to the
spot wherein you command the first general survey of this unparalleled
front. The delicacy, the finish, the harmonious intricacy, and faery-like
lightness, of the whole--even to the summit of the spire;--which latter
indeed has the appearance of filigree work, raised by enchantment, and
through the interstices of which the bright blue sky appears with a lustre
of which you have no conception in England--all this, I say, perfectly
delights and overwhelms you. You want words to express your ideas, and the
extent of your gratification. You feel convinced that the magnificent
edifice before you seems to be the <EM>ne plus ultra</EM> of human skill
in ornamental gothic architecture. Undoubtedly one regrets here, as at
Antwerp, the absence of a corresponding tower; but you are to form your
judgment upon what is <EM>actually</EM> before you, and, at the same time,
to bear in mind that this tower and spire--for it partakes of both
characters--is full <EM>four hundred and seventy four</EM> English feet in
height!<A name="fnref_206"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_206">206</A>--and, consequently, some twenty or thirty feet only
lower than the top of St. Peter's at Rome. One is lost in astonishment, on
bearing such an altitude in mind, considering the delicacy of the spire.
There is no place fitting for a satisfactory view of it, within its
immediate vicinity.<A name="fnref_207"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_207">207</A></P>

<P>This western front, or facade, is divided into three stages or
compartments. The bottom or lower one is occupied by three magnificent
porches; of which the central is by far the loftiest and most ornamental.
The period of their execution is from the year 1270 to 1320: a period,
when gothic architecture was probably at its highest pitch of perfection.
The central porch is divided into five compartments on each side--forming
an angle of about forty-five degrees with the door-way. The lower parts of
these divisions contain each a statue, of the size of life, upon its
respective pediment. The upper parts, which blend with the arch-like
construction, are filled with small statues, upon pediments, having a sort
of brilliant, fretted appearance. All these figures are representations of
characters in Scripture. Again, above this archway, forming the central
ornaments of the sharper angles, are the figures of the Almighty, the
Virgin and Child, and Solomon. In front, above the door way, upon a flat
surface, are four sculptured compartments; devoted to scriptural subjects.
The same may be said of the right and left porch. They are equally
elaborate, and equally devoted to representations of scriptural subjects.
They will have it, that, according to tradition, the daughter of Ervin de
Steinbach, the chief architect of the western front, worked a great deal
at this central porch, and even sculptured several of the figures. However
this may be, the <EM>tout ensemble</EM> is really beyond any thing which
could be satisfactorily conveyed by a written description.</P>

<P>We now cast our eye upon the second division of this stupendous facade;
and here our attention is almost exclusively devoted to the enormous
circular or marygold window, in the central compartment. It is filled with
stained glass--and you are to know that the circumference of the outer
circle is one hundred and sixty-English feet: or about fifty-three feet in
diameter; and I challenge you to shew me the like--in any building of
which you have any knowledge!</P>

<P>Perhaps the most wonderful part of this structure is the open filigree
work of the tower, immediately above the platform: though I admit that the
<EM>spiral</EM> part is exceedingly curious and elaborate. Of course there
was no examining such a wonder without mounting to the platform, and
ascending the tower itself. The platform is about three hundred feet from
the pavement. We quitted this tenement, and walked straight forward upon
the platform. What a prospect was before us. There flowed the RHINE! I
felt an indescribable joy on my first view of that majestic river. There
it flowed ... broad and rapid ... and apparently peaceful, within its low
banks. On the other, or eastern side of it, was a range of lofty hills, of
a mountainous character. On the opposite side of the town ran the great
chain of hills--called the VOSGES--which we had crossed in our route
hither; and of which we had now a most extensive and unobstructed view.
These hills were once the abode of adventurous chieftains and powerful
nobles; and there was scarcely an eminence but what had been formerly
crowned by a baronial castle.<A name="fnref_208"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_208">208</A> Below, appeared the houses of Strasbourg ... shrunk
to rabbit-hutches--and the people ... to emmets!</P>

<P>It remained to ascend the opposite tower. At each of the four corners
there is a spiral stair-case, of which the exterior is open work,
consisting of slender but lofty pillars; so that the ascending figure is
seen at every convolution. It has a fearful appearance to the adventurer:
but there is scarcely the possibility of danger. You go round and round,
and observe three distinct terminations of the central work
within--forming three roofs--of which, the <EM>third</EM> is eminently
beautiful. I could not help expressing my astonishment at some of the
exterior columns, which could not be much less than threescore feet in
height, and scarcely twelve inches in diameter! Having gained the top of
one of these corner spiral stair-cases, I breathed and looked around me. A
new feature presented itself to my view. About one hundred feet beneath,
was the body of this huge cathedral. Immediately above, rose the
beautifully-tapering and curiously ornamented SPIRE--to the height of
probably, one hundred and twenty-five feet! It seemed indeed as if both
tower and spire were direct ladders to the sky. The immortal artist who
constructed them, and who lived to witness the completion of his
structure, was JOAN HÜLTZ, a native of Cologne. The date of their
completion is 1449. Thus, on the continent as well as in England, the
period of the most florid style of gothic architecture was during the
first half of the fifteenth century.</P>

<P>I essayed to mount to the very pinnacle; or <EM>bouton</EM> of the
spire; but the ascent was impracticable--owing to the stair-case being
under repair. On the summit of this spire, there once stood a <EM>statue
of the Virgin,</EM> above a cross. That statue was taken down at the end
of the fifteenth century, and is now placed over the south porch. But,
what do you think supplied its place during the late Revolution, or in the
year of our Lord 1794, on the 4th day of May? Truly, nothing less than a
large cap, made of tin, and painted red--called the <EM>Cap of
Liberty!</EM> Thank heaven, this latter was pulled down in due time--and
an oblong diamond-shaped stone is now the finishing piece of masonry of
this wonderful building. In descending, I stopped again at the platform,
and was requested to see the GREAT BELL; of which I had heard the
deep-mouthed roar half a dozen times a day, since my arrival. It is
perhaps the finest toned bell in Europe, and appeared to me terrifically
large--being nearer eight than seven feet high.<A name="fnref_209"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_209">209</A> They begin to toll it at four or five
o'clock in the summer-mornings, to announce that the gates of the town are
opened. In case of fire at night, it is very loudly tolled; and during a
similar accident in the day time, they suspend a pole, with a red flag at
the end of it, over that part of the platform which is in a line with the
direction of the fire.</P>

<P>A grand defect in the structure of this Cathedral, as it strikes me,
is, that the nave and transepts do not seem to belong to such a western
front. They sink into perfect insignificance. Nor is the style of their
exterior particularly deserving of description. Yet there is <EM>one</EM>
feature in the external architecture of this Cathedral--namely, a series
or suite of DROLLERIES ... of about four or five feet high ... which
cannot fail to attract the antiquary's especial notice. These figures are
coarsely but spiritedly cut in stone. They are placed upon the bracket
which supports the galleries, or balcony, of the eastern side of the
facade of the tower, and are about sixty-five English feet from the
ground. They extend to thirty-two feet in length. Through the kind offices
of my friend Mr. Schweighæuser, junior, (of whom by and by) I have
obtained drawings of these droll subjects,<A name="fnref_210"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_210">210</A> and I am sure that, in common with
many of our friends, you will be amused with the sight of a few of them.
They are probably of the date of 1370;</P>

<DIV class="figcenter"  style="width:50%;"><IMG width="100%"
src="images/398.png" alt=
"Drolleries"></DIV>

<P>The common people call this series the <EM>Sabbath of Demons,</EM> or
<EM>the Dance of the Witches</EM>. You are to know, however, that on the
opposite side of the cathedral there is a series of figures, of the same
size, and executed nearly in the same style of art, descriptive of
scriptural events, mixed with allegorical subjects. Having now pointed out
what appears to me to be chiefly interesting in the <EM>exterior</EM> of
this marvellous building, it is right that I give you some notion of its
<EM>interior</EM>: which will however occupy but a short portion of your
attention. Indeed--I grieve to speak it--both the exterior and interior of
the <EM>nave</EM> are wholly unworthy of such a magnificent
west-front.</P>

<P>The nave and choir together are about three hundred and fifty-five
English feet in length; of which the nave is two hundred and
forty-four--evidently of too scanty dimensions. The width of the nave and
side aisles is one hundred and thirty-two feet: the height of the nave is
only seventy-two feet. The larger of the nine clustered columns is full
seventy-two feet in circumference; the more delicate, thirty feet. There
is really nothing striking in this nave; except that, on turning round,
and looking up to the painted glass of the circular or marygold window,
you observe the colours of it, which are very rich, and absolutely gay,
compared with those of the other windows. There is a profusion of painted
glass in almost all the windows; but generally of a sombre tint, and of a
correspondent gloomy effect. Indeed, in consequence of this profusion, the
cathedral absolutely wants light.</P>

<P>The choir is sixty-seven feet wide, without side aisles, and is much
lower than the nave. It is impossible to speak of this choir without
indignation. My good friend--the whole of this interior has recently
undergone rather a martyrdom than a metamorphosis. The sides are almost
entirely covered with <EM>Grecian</EM> pilasters and pillars; and so are
the ornaments about the altar. What adds to the wretched effect of the
whole, is, a coat of <EM>white-wash</EM>, which was liberally bestowed
upon it some forty years ago; and which will require at least the lapse of
another century to subdue its staring effect. There are only three chapels
in this cathedral. Of <EM>altars</EM> there are not fewer than twelve: the
principal being in the chapels of St. Lawrence and St. Catharine.</P>

<P>It was near the chapel of <EM>St. Catharine</EM>, that, on the morning
of our first visit, we witnessed a group of country people, apparently
from the neighbourhood of <EM>Saverne</EM>--from their huge, broad, flat
hats--engaged in devotion before the image of some favourite saint. The
rays of a bright sun darted through the windows, softened by the varied
tints of the stained glass, upon their singular countenances and costumes;
and the effect was irresistibly striking and interesting.</P>

<P>In the centre of the south transept, there rises a fine, slender,
clustered column, reaching to its very summit. On the exterior of this
column--placed one above another, but retreating or advancing, or in full
view, according to the position of the spectator--are several figures,
chiefly females; probably five feet high, with labels or scrolls, upon
each of which is an inscription. I never saw any thing more elegant and
more striking of its kind. These figures reach a great way up the
pillar--probably to the top--but at this moment I cannot say decidedly. It
is here, too, that the famous Strasbourg <EM>Clock</EM>, (about which one
Dasypodius hath published a Latin treatise in a slim quarto volume<A name=
"fnref_211"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_211">211</A> is placed. This,
and the tower, were called the <EM>two great wonders of Germany</EM>. This
clock may be described in few words: premising, that it was preceded by a
clock of very extraordinary workmanship, fabricated in the middle of the
fourteenth century--of which, the <EM>only</EM> existing portion is, a
<EM>cock</EM>, upon the top of the left perpendicular ornament, which,
upon the hourly chiming of the bells, used to flap his wings, stretch out
his neck, and crow twice; but being struck by lightning in the year 1640,
it lost its power of action and of sending forth sound. No modern skill
has been able to make this cock crow, or to shake his wings again. The
clock however is now wholly out of order, and should be placed elsewhere.
It is very lofty; perhaps twenty feet high: is divided into three parts,
of which the central part represents <EM>Our Saviour</EM> and
<EM>Death</EM>, in the middle, each in the act as if to strike a bell.
When, in complete order, Death used to come forward to strike the
<EM>quarters</EM>; and, having struck them, was instantly repelled by our
Saviour. When he came forward to strike the <EM>hour</EM>, our Saviour in
turn retreated:--a whimsical and not very comprehensible arrangement. But
old clocks used to be full of these conceits.</P>

<P>Upon throwing an eye over what I have just written, I find that I have
omitted to notice the celebrated STONE PULPIT, in the nave, enriched with
small figures--of the latter end of the fifteenth century. In fact, the
date of 1485, in arabic numerals, (if I remember rightly) is at the bottom
of it, to the right of the steps. This pulpit, my good friend, is nothing
less than the very ecclesiastical rostrum from which the famous <EM>John
Geyler</EM> thundered his anathemas against the monkish clergy. You may
remember that some slight notice was taken of it at the beginning of this
letter, in which the progress of Protestantism at Strasbourg was attempted
to be traced. I will frankly own to you, that, of all pulpits, throughout
Normandy, or in Paris--as yet examined by me--I have seen none which
approaches to THIS; so rich, varied, and elaborate are its sculptured
ornaments.<A name="fnref_212"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_212">212</A>
The Revolutionists could only contrive to knock off the figure which was
upon the top of the canopy, with other contiguous ornaments; all of which
might be easily restored.</P>

<P>A word now about the great <EM>Organ</EM>. If Strasbourg have been
famous for architects, masons, bell-founders, and clock-makers, it has
been not less so for organ builders. As early as the end of the thirteenth
century, there were several organs in this cathedral: very curious in
their structure, and very sonorous in their notes. The present great
organ, on the <EM>left side</EM> of the nave, on entering at the western
door, was built by Silbermann about a century-ago: and is placed about
fifty feet above the pavement. It has six bellowses, each bellows being
twelve feet long and six wide: but they are made to act by a very simple
and sure process. The tone is tremendous--when all the stops are pulled
out--as I once heard it, during the performance of a particularly grand
chorus! Yet is this tone mellow and pleasing at the same time.
Notwithstanding the organ could be hardly less than three hundred feet
distant from the musicians in the choir, it sent forth sounds so powerful
and grand--as almost to overwhelm the human voice, with the accompaniments
of trombones and serpents. Perhaps you will not be astonished at this,
when I inform you that it contains not fewer than two thousand two hundred
and forty-two pipes. This is not the first time you have heard me commend
the organs upon the Continent.</P>

<P>One of the most remarkable features belonging to the history of
Strasbourg cathedral, is, the number of <EM>shocks of earthquakes</EM>
which have affected the building. It is barely possible to enumerate all
these frightful accidents; and still more difficult to give credence to
one third of them. They seem to have happened two or three times every
century; and, latterly, yet more frequently. Take one recital as a
specimen: and believe it--if you can. In the year 1728, so great was the
agitation of the earth, that the tower was moved one foot out of its
perpendicular direction--but recovered its former position presently.
"What however is <EM>quite certain</EM>--(says Grandidier)--the holy
water, contained in a stone reservoir or basin, at the bottom of a column,
near the pavement, was thrown by this same agitation, to upwards of
<EM>half the height of a man</EM>--and to the distance of <EM>eighteen
feet!</EM> The record of this marvellous transaction is preserved in a
Latin inscription, on a slab of black marble, fastened to the lower part
of the tower, near the platform."<A name="fnref_213"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_213">213</A> In 1744 a severe tempest of thunder and lightning
occasioned some serious injuries to portions of the cathedral; but in 1759
it suffered still more from a similar cause. Indeed the havoc among the
slighter ornamental parts, including several delicately carved figures, is
recorded to have been dreadful.</P>

<P>Of the subordinate churches of Strasbourg, the principal, both for size
and antiquity, is that of <EM>St. Thomas</EM>. I visited it several times.
The exterior is one of the most tasteless jumbles of all styles and ages
of art that can be imagined; and a portion of it is covered with brick.
But I question if there be not parts much older than the cathedral. The
interior compensates somewhat for the barbarism of the outside. It is
large and commodious, but sadly altered from its original construction;
and has recently been trimmed up and smartened in the true church-warden
style. The great boast of this church is its MONUMENTS; which, it must be
confessed, are upon the whole exceedingly interesting. As to their
antiquity, I noticed two or three of the thirteenth century; but they
pretend to run up as high as the tenth. Indeed I saw one inscription of
the eleventh century--executed in gothic letters, such as we observe of
the latter end of the sixteenth. This could not be a coeval inscription;
for I doubt whether there exist, any where, a monumental tablet of the
eleventh century executed in <EM>coeval gothic</EM> letters. The service
performed here is after the confession of Augsbourg; in other words,
according to the reformed Lutheran church. A small crucifix, placed upon
an altar between the nave and the choir, delicately marks this
distinction; for Luther, you know, did not wage an interminable war
against crucifixes.</P>

<P>Of <EM>modern</EM> monuments, the boast and glory of this church is
that of the famous MARSHAL SAXE; who died at the age of 55, in the year
1755. While I was looking very intently at it, the good verger gently put
a printed description of it into my hands, on a loose quarto sheet. I
trust to be forgiven if I read only its first sentence:--<EM>Cette grande
composition réunit aux richesse de l'art des Phidias et des Bouchardon,
les traits de la grande poésie.</EM>" "Take any shape but this"--thought I
to myself--and, folding it up as gently as it had been delivered to me, I
put it into my pocket. My good friend, I do beseech you to hear me
out--when I preface my remarks by saying, that, of all monuments,
<EM>this</EM> is one of the most tasteless and uninteresting. Listen to a
brief but faithful description of it.</P>

<P>An immense pyramidal-shaped gray marble forms the background. Upon such
a back-ground there might have been a group of a <EM>dozen</EM> figures at
least. However, there happen to be only <EM>four</EM> of the human
species, and three of animals. These human figures are, the Marshal; a
woman weeping lustily--I had almost said blubbering; (intended to
represent France) Hercules; and a little child--of some order or degree,
not less affected than the female. The animals are, a lion, a leopard,
(which latter has a bear-like form) and an eagle. I will now tell you what
they are all doing. Before the Marshal, is an opened grave; into which
this illustrious hero, clad in complete armour, is about to march with a
quiet, measured step--as unconcernedly, as if he were descending a flight
of steps which led to a conservatory. The woman--that is France--is, in
the meantime, weeping aloud; pointing to the grave, and very persuasively
intreating the Marshal to enter--as his mortal moments have expired. I
should add that death--a large formidable-looking figure, veiled by a
piece of drapery, is also at hand: seeming to imply that hesitation and
reluctance, on the part of the hero, are equally unavailing. Next comes
Hercules; who is represented as stationary, thoughtful, and
sorrow-stricken, as France is agitated and in motion. The lion and leopard
(one representing Holland, and the other England--intending to convey the
idea that the hero had beaten the armies of both countries) are between
the Marshal and Hercules: the leopard is lying upon his back--in a very
frolicksome attitude. The lion is also not less abstracted from the
general grief of the figures. And this large, ugly, unmeaning
composition--they have the temerity to call the union of art by Phidias
and Bouchardon--with the inspiration of sublime poetry! I will make no
comments.<A name="fnref_214"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_214">214</A>
It is one of those <EM>felicitous</EM> efforts which have the enviable
distinction of carrying its own text and commentary. Below this vast mural
monument, is a vault, containing the body of the Marshal. I descended into
it, and found it well ventilated and dry. The coffin is immediately
obvious: it contains the body of the chieftain enclosed in two cases--of
which the first is <EM>silver</EM>, and the second <EM>copper</EM>. The
heart is, I believe, elsewhere.</P>

<P>Forming a strikingly happy contrast to this huge, unmeaning production-
-are the modest and unassuming monuments of <EM>Schoepflin</EM>,
<EM>Oberlin</EM>, and <EM>Koch</EM>: men, of whom Strasbourg has good
reason to be proud. Nor let the monument of old <EM>Sebastian Schmidt</EM>
escape the notice and commendation of the pensive observer. These were all
"fine fellows in their day:" and died, including the illustrious Marshal,
steady in the faith they had espoused--that is, in the belief and practice
of the tenets of the reformed church. I have no time for a particular
description of these monuments. Schoepflin's consists of a bronze bust of
himself placed in the front of a white marble urn, between two
cinnamon-colour columns, of the Corinthian order--of free stone. The head
is thought to be very like. Oberlin's is in better taste. You see only his
profile, by Ohmacht, in white marble--very striking. The accompaniments
are figures in white marble, of which a muse, in rilievo, is larger than
life. The inscriptions, both for Schoepflin and Oberlin, are short and
simple, and therefore appropriate. The monument of Koch is not less
simple. It consists of his bust--about to be crowned with a fillet of
oaken leaves--by a figure representing the city of Strasbourg. Below the
bust is another figure weeping--and holding beneath its arms, a scroll,
upon which the works of the deceased are enumerated. Koch died in his
seventy-sixth year, in the year 1813. Ohmacht is also the sculptor of
Koch's monument. Upon the whole, I am not sure that I have visited any
church, since the cathedral of Rouen, of which the interior is more
interesting, on the score of monuments, than that of St. Thomas at
Strasbourg.</P>

<P>I do not know that it is necessary to say any thing about the old
churches of St. Stephen and St. Martin: except that the former is supposed
to be the most ancient. It was built of stone, and said to be placed upon
a spot in which was a Roman fort--the materials of which served for a
portion of the present building. St. Martin's was erected in 1381 upon a
much finer plan than that of <EM>St. Arbogaste</EM>--which is said to have
been built in the middle of the twelfth century. Among the churches, now
no longer <EM>wholly</EM> appropriated to sacred uses, is that called the
<EM>New Temple</EM>--attached to which is the Public Library. The service
in this church is according to the Protestant persuasion. I say this
Church is not <EM>wholly</EM> devoted to religious rites: for what was
once the <EM>choir</EM>, contains, at bottom, the BOOKS belonging to the
public University; and, at top, those which were bequeathed to the same
establishment by Schoepflin. The general effect--both from the pavement
below, and the gallery above--is absolutely transporting. Shall I tell you
wherefore? This same ancient choir--now devoted to <STRONG>printed
tomes</STRONG>--contains some lancet-shaped windows of <EM>stained
glass</EM> of the most beautiful and exquisite pattern and colours!...
such as made me wholly forget those at <EM>Toul</EM>, and <EM>almost</EM>
those at <EM>St. Owen</EM>. Even the stained glass of the cathedral, here,
was recollected ... only to suffer by the comparison! It should seem that
the artist had worked with alternate dissolutions of amethyst, topaz,
ruby, garnet, and emerald. Look at the first three windows, to the left on
entering, about an hour before sun-set:--they seem to fill the whole place
with a preternatural splendor! The pattern is somewhat of a Persian
description, and I should apprehend the antiquity of the workmanship to be
scarcely exceeding three hundred years. Yet I must be allowed to say, that
these exquisitely sparkling, if not unrivalled, specimens of stained
glass, do not belong to a place now <EM>wholly</EM> occupied by
<EM>books</EM>. Could they not be placed in the chapel of St. Lawrence, or
of St. Catharine, in the cathedral?</P>

<P>As I am now at the close of my account of ecclesiastical edifices--and
as this last church happens to be closely connected with a building of a
different description--namely, The PUBLIC LIBRARY--you will allow me to
<EM>colophonise</EM> my first Strasbourg epistle with some account of the
<EM>contents</EM> of this library.</P>

<P>The amiable and excellent younger Schweighæuser, who is head librarian,
and one of the Professors in this Gymnase, was so obliging as to lend me
the key of the library, to which I had access at all hours of the day. The
public hours are from two till four, Sundays excepted. I own that this
accommodation was extremely agreeable and convenient to me. I was under no
restraint, and thus left to my own conscience alone not to abuse the
privilege conceded. That conscience has never given me one "prick" since
the conclusion of my researches.<A name="fnref_215"></A><A class="fnref"
href="#fn_215">215</A></P>

<P>My researches were usually carried on above stairs, at the table where
the visitors sat. Of the MSS. I did not deem it worth while to take any
particular account; but there was <EM>one</EM>, so choice, so splendid, so
curious, so interesting, and in such an extraordinary state of
preservation, that you may as well know it is called the famous <EM>Hortus
Deliciarum</EM> of <EM>Herarde, Abbess of Landsberg</EM>. The subjects are
miscellaneous; and most elaborately represented by illuminations. Battles,
sieges, men tumbling from ladders which reach to the sky--conflagrations,
agriculture--devotion, penitence--revenge, murder,--in short, there is
hardly a passion, animating the human breast, but what is represented
here. The figures in armour have <EM>nasals</EM>, and are in quilted mail:
and I think there can be little doubt but that both the text and the
decorations are of the latter end of the twelfth century. It is so perfect
in all its parts, and so rich of its particular description, that it not
only well merits the labour which has been bestowed upon it by its recent
editor Mr. Engleheardt, but it may probably vie with any similar
production in Europe.<A name="fnref_216"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_216">216</A></P>

<P>However, of other MSS. you will I am sure give me credit for having
examined the celebrated <EM>Depositions in the law-suit between Fust and
Gutemberg</EM>--so intimately connected with the history of early
printing, and so copiously treated upon by recent bibliographers.<A name=
"fnref_217"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_217">217</A> I own that I
inspected these depositions (in the German language) with no ordinary
curiosity. They are doubtless most precious; yet I cannot help suspecting
that the <EM>character</EM> or letter is <EM>not</EM> of the time; namely
of 1440. It should rather seem to be of the sixteenth century. Perhaps at
the commencement of it. These documents are written in a small folio
volume, in one uniform hand--a kind of law-gothic--from beginning to end.
The volume has the following title on the exterior; "<EM>Dicta Testium
magni consilij Anno dni m<SUP>o</SUP>. cccc<SUP>o</SUP>. Tricesimo
nono</EM>. The paper is strong and thick, and has a pair of scales for the
water-mark. The younger Schweighæuser thinks my doubts about its age not
well founded; conceiving it to be a coeval document. But this does not
affect its authenticity, as it may have been an accurate and attested
copy--of an original which has now perished. Certainly the whole book has
very much the air of a <EM>Copy</EM>: and besides, would not the originals
have been upon separate rolls of parchment?<A name="fnref_218"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_218">218</A></P>

<P>I now come to the PRINTED BOOKS: of which, according to the MS.
catalogue by Oberlin, (who was head librarian here) there are not fewer
<EM>than four thousand three hundred, printed before the year
1520</EM>:--and of these, again, upwards of <EM>eleven hundred without
dates</EM>. This, at first hearing, sounds, what the curious would call,
promising; but I must say, that of the <EM>dated</EM> and
<EM>dateless</EM> books, printed before the year 1500, which I took down,
and carefully opened--and this number could not be less than four or five
hundred--there was scarcely one in five which repaid the toil of
examination: and this too, with a thermometer frequently standing at
eighty-nine and ninety, in the shade in the open air! Fortunately for my
health, and for the exertion of physical strength, the public library
happened to be very cool--while all the windows were opened, and through
the openings was frequently heard the sound of young voices, practising
the famous <EM>Martin Luther's Hymn</EM>--as it is called. This latter was
particularly grateful to me. I heard the master first sing a stave, and he
was in general accurately followed by his pupils--who displayed the
well-known early tact of Germans in the science of music. But to revert to
the early printed books.</P>

<P>FIRST GERMAN BIBLE; supposed to have been <EM>printed by Mentelin</EM>;
without date: Folio. Towards the latter half of this copy, there are some
interesting embellishments, in outline, in a bistre tint. The invention
and execution of many of them are admirable. Where they are
<EM>coloured</EM>, they lose their proper effect. An illumination, at the
beginning of the book of <EM>Esther</EM>, bears the unequivocal date of
1470: but the edition was certainly four or five years earlier. This Bible
is considered to be the earliest German version: but it is not so.</P>

<P>LATIN BIBLE, BY MENTELIN: in his second character. This Bible I saw for
the first time; but Panzer is decidedly wrong in saying that the types
resemble the larger ones in Mentelin's <EM>Valerius Maximus</EM>,
<EM>Virgil</EM> and <EM>Terence</EM>: they may be nearly as tall, but are
not so broad and large. From a ms. note, the 402d leaf appears to be
wanting. This copy is a singularly fine one. It is white, and large, and
with rough edges throughout. It is also in its first binding, of wood.</P>

<P>LATIN BIBLE; <EM>printed by Eggesteyn</EM>. Here are several editions,
and a duplicate of the first--which is printed in the second smallest
character of Eggesteyn.<A name="fnref_219"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_219">219</A> The two copies of this first edition are pretty much
alike for size and condition: but <EM>one</EM> of them, with handsome
illuminations at the beginning of each volume, has the precious coeval ms.
date of 1468--as represented by the fac-simile of it in <EM>Schoepflin's
Vind. Typog. Tab. V.</EM> Probably the date of the printing might have
been at least a year earlier.</P>

<P>LATIN BIBLE: <EM>printed by Jenson</EM>, 1479. Folio. A fine copy, upon
paper. The first page is illuminated.</P>

<P>To this list of impressions of the SACRED TEXT, may be added a fine
copy of the SCLAVONIAN BIBLE of 1584, folio, with wood cuts, and another
of the HUNGARIAN Bible of 1626, folio: the latter in double columns, with
a crowdedly-printed margin, and an engraved frontispiece.</P>

<P>As to books upon miscellaneous subjects, I shall lay before you,
without any particular order, my notes of the following: Of the
<EM>Speculum Morale</EM> of P. Bellovacensis, here said to be printed by
Mentelin in 1476, in double columns, roman type, folio--there is a copy,
in one volume, of tremendously large dimensions; as fine, clean, and
crackling as possible. Also a copy of the <EM>Speculum Judiciale</EM> of
Durandus, <EM>printed at Strasbourg by Hussner and Rekenhub</EM>, in 1473,
folio. Hussner was a citizen of Strasbourg, and his associate a priest at
Mentz. Here is also a perfect copy of the Latin PTOLEMY, of the supposed
date of 1462, with a fine set of the copper-plates.</P>

<P>But I must make distinct mention of a <EM>Latin Chronicle, printed by
Gotz de Sletztat</EM> in 1474, in folio. It is executed in a coarse, large
gothic type, with many capital roman letters. At the end of the
alphabetical index of 35 leaves, we read as follows:</P>

<P CLASS="quote">DEO GRATIAS.<BR>
<STRONG>A tpe ade vsqz ad annos cristi 1474<BR>
Acta et gesta hic suffitienter nuclient <BR>
Sola spes mea. In virginis gracia <BR>
Nicholaus Gotz. De Sletzstat.</STRONG></P>

<P>The preceding is on the recto; on the reverse of the same leaf is an
account of Inventors of <EM>arts</EM>: no mention is made of that of
<EM>printing</EM>. Then the prologue to the Chronicle, below which is the
device of Gotz;<A name="fnref_220"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_220">220</A> having his name subjoined. The text of the Chronicle
concludes at page CCLXXX--printed numerals--with an account of an event
which took place in the year 1470. But the present copy contains another,
and the concluding leaf--which may be missing in some copies--wherein
there is a particular notice of a splendid event which took place in 1473,
between Charles Duke of Burgundy, and Frederick the Roman Emperor, with
Maximilian his Son; together with divers dukes, earls, and counts
attending. The text of this leaf ends thus;</P>

<P CLASS="quote"><EM>SAVE GAIRT VIVE BVRGVND.</EM></P>

<P>Below, within a circle, "Sixtus quartus." This work is called, in a ms.
prefix, the <EM>Chronicle of Foresius</EM>. I never saw, or heard of,
another copy. The present is fine and sound; and bound in wood, covered
with leather.</P>

<P>Here are two copies of St. <EM>Jerom's Epistles, printed by
Schoeffher</EM> in 1470; of which that below stairs is one of the most
magnificent imaginable; in two folio volumes. Hardly any book can exceed,
and few equal it, in size and condition--unless it be the theological
works of ARCHBISHOP ANTONIUS, <EM>printed by Koeberger</EM>, in 1477, in
one enormous folio volume. As a specimen of Koeberger's press, I am unable
at the present moment to mention any thing which approaches it. I must
also notice a copy of the <EM>Speculum Humanæ Salvationis, printed at
Basle, by Richel</EM>, in 1476, folio. It is a prodigious volume, full of
wood cuts, and printed in double columns in a handsome gothic type. This
work seems to be rather a <EM>History of the Bible</EM>; having ten times
the matter of that which belongs to the work with this title usually
prefixed. The copy is in its original wooden binding.</P>

<P>JUNIANUS MAIUS. <EM>De Propriet. Priscor. Verborum, printed at Treviso
by Bernard de Colonia</EM>, 1477, folio. I do not remember to have before
seen any specimen of this printer's type: but what he has done here, is
sufficient to secure for him typographical immortality. This is indeed a
glorious copy--perfectly large paper--of an elegantly printed book, in a
neat gothic type, in double columns. The first letter of the text is
charmingly illuminated. I shall conclude these miscellaneous articles by
the notice of two volumes, in the list of ROMANCES, of exceedingly rare
occurrence. These romances are called <EM>Tyturell</EM> and
<EM>Partzifal</EM>. The author of them was <EM>Wolfram von Escenbach</EM>.
They are each of the date of 1477, in folio. The Tyturell is printed
prose-wise, and the Partzifal in a metrical form.</P>

<P>We now come to the Roman CLASSICS, (for of the Greek there are <EM>few
or none</EM>)--before the year 1500. Let me begin with <EM>Virgil</EM>.
Here is <EM>Mentelin's</EM> very rare edition; but cropt, scribbled upon,
and wanting several leaves. However, there is a most noble and perfect
copy of Servius's Commentary upon the same poet, <EM>printed by
Valdarfer</EM> in 1471, folio, and bound in primitive boards. There are
two perfect copies of <EM>Mentelin's</EM> edition (which is the first) of
VALERIUS MAXIMUS, of which one is wormed and cropt. The <EM>other</EM>
Mentelin copy of the Valerius Maximus, without the Commentary, is perhaps
the largest I ever saw--with the ancient ms. signatures at the
bottom-corners of the leaves. Unluckily, the margins are rather
plentifully charged with ms. memoranda.</P>

<P>Of CICERO, there are of course numerous early editions. I did not see
the <EM>De Officiis</EM> of 1465, or of 1466, of which Hermann speaks, and
to which he affixes the <EM>novel</EM> date of 1462:--but I did see the
<EM>De Oratore</EM>, printed by <EM>Vindelin de Spira</EM> without date;
and <EM>such</EM> a copy I shall probably never see again! The colour and
substance of the paper are yet more surprising than the size.</P>

<P>It is hardly possible to see a finer copy of the <EM>Scriptores Hist.
Augustæ, printed by P. de Lavagna</EM> in 1475, folio. It possesses all
the legitimate evidences of pristine condition, and is bound in its first
coat of oak. Here is a very fine copy of the <EM>Plutarchi Vitæ
Paralellæ</EM>, printed in the letter R, in two large folio volumes, bound
in wood, covered by vellum of the sixteenth century. But, if of
<EM>any</EM> book, it is of the first edition of <EM>Catullus Tibullus et
Propertius</EM>, of 1472, folio--that this Library has just reason to be
proud. Here are in fact <EM>two</EM> copies, equally sound, pure and
large: but in <EM>one</EM> the <EM>Propertius</EM> is wanting;<A name=
"fnref_221"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_221">221</A> in lieu of which,
however, there is the first edition of JUVENAL and PERSIUS by V. de
Spira--in equal purity of condition. The perfect copy has the SYLVÆ of
STATIUS subjoined. It should seem, therefore, that the Juvenal and Persius
had supplied the place of the Propertius and Statius, in one copy. You are
well aware of the extreme rarity of this first edition of Catullus
Tibullus et Propertius.</P>

<P>I now take leave of the <EM>Public Library of Strasbourg</EM>; not
however without mentioning rather an amusing anecdote connected with some
of the books just described; nor without an observation or two upon the
present state of the library. The anecdote is thoroughly bibliographical.
After having examined some of the finer books before mentioned, and
especially having dwelt upon the Latin Bible of Mentelin, and a few copies
of the rarer Classics, I ventured to descant upon the propriety of
<EM>parting</EM> with those for which there was <EM>no use</EM>, and
which, without materially strengthening their own collection, might, by an
advantageous sale, enable them to enrich their collection by valuable
modern books: of which they obviously stood in <EM>need</EM>. I then
proposed so many hundred francs, for such and such volumes. Messrs.
Schweighæuser, jun. Dahler, and several other professors were standing
round me--when I made this proposition. On the conclusion of it, professor
Dahler put his hand upon my shoulder--stooped down--(for I was sitting the
whole time)--and looking half archly, replied thus: "Monsieur le
Bibliographe, vous raisonnez bien: mais--nous conserverons nos anciens
livres." These sturdy conservators were not to be shaken; and none but
<EM>duplicates</EM> were to be parted with.<A name="fnref_222"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_222">222</A></P>

<P>The next observation relates to the collection. Never did a collection
stand in greater need of being weeded. There are medical books sufficient
to supply six copies for the library of every castellated mansion along
the Vosges<A name="fnref_223"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_223">223</A>-- should any of them ever be repaired and put in order.
Schoepflin's library furnishes many duplicates both in history and
theology; and in <EM>Classics</EM> they should at least make good their
series of the more important <EM>first Editions</EM>. The want of a
perfect <EM>Virgil</EM> by <EM>Mentelin</EM>, and the want of a <EM>first
Terence</EM>, by the same printer--their boasted townsman--are reproachful
wants. At any rate, they should not let slip any opportunity of purchasing
the first <EM>Ovid, Horace, Ausonius</EM>, and <EM>Lucretius</EM>. No man
is more deeply impressed with a conviction of these wants, than the
present chief librarian, the younger Schweighæuser; but, unfortunately,
the pecuniary means of supplying them are slender indeed. I find this to
be the case wherever I go. The deficiency of funds, for the completion of
libraries, may however be the cry of <EM>other</EM> countries besides
<EM>France</EM>.</P>

<P>As to booksellers, for the sale of modern works, and for doing, what is
called "a great stroke of business," there is no one to compare with the
house of TREUTTEL and WÜRTZ--of which firm, as you may remember, very
honourable mention was made in one of my latter letters from Paris. Their
friendly attention and hospitable kindness are equal to their high
character as men of business. It was frequently in their shop that I met
with some of the savants of Strasbourg; and among them, the venerable and
amiable LICHTENBERGER, author of that very judicious and pains taking
compilation entitled <EM>Initia Typographica</EM>. I was also introduced
to divers of the learned, whose names I may be pardoned for having
forgotten. The simplicity of character, which here marks almost every man
of education, is not less pleasing than profitable to a traveller who
wishes to make himself acquainted with the literature of the country
through which he passes.</P>

<H3 class="letter">LETTER XIV.</H3>

<P>SOCIETY. ENVIRONS OF STRASBOURG. DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE, MANNERS AND
CUSTOMS. LITERATURE. LANGUAGE.</P>

<P>My last letter, however copious, was almost wholly confined to
<EM>views of interiors</EM>; that is to say, to an account of the
Cathedral and of the Public Library. I shall now continue the narrative
with views of interiors of a different description; with some slight
notices of the <EM>society</EM> and of the city of Strasbourg; concluding
the whole, as well as closing my Strasbourg despatches, with a summary
account of manners, customs, and literature.</P>

<P>The great <EM>Greek luminary</EM>, not only of this place, but perhaps
of Germany--the ELDER SCHWEIGHÆUSER--happens to be absent. His son tells
me that he is at <EM>Baden</EM> for the benefit of the waters, and advises
me to take that "enchanting spot" (as he calls it) in my way to Stuttgart.
"'Twill be only a trifling détour." What however will be the
<EM>chief</EM> temptation--as I frankly told the younger
Schweighæuser--would be the society of his Father; to whom the son has
promised a strong letter of introduction. I told you in my last that I had
seen LICHTENBERGER at Treuttel and Würtz's. I have since called upon the
old gentleman; and we immediately commenced a bibliographical parley. But
it was chiefly respecting Lord Spencer's copies of the <EM>Letters of
Indulgence of Pope Nicolas V.</EM> of the date of 1455, that he made the
keenest enquiries. "Was the date legitimate?" I assured him there could be
no doubt of it; and that what Hæberlin had said, followed by Lambinet, had
no reference whatever to his Lordship's copies--for that, in
<EM>them</EM>, the final units were compressed into a V and not extended
by five strokes, thus--<EM>iiiij</EM>. As he was unacquainted with my
account of these copies in the <EM>Bibliotheca Spenceriana</EM>, I was
necessarily minute in the foregoing statement. The worthy old
bibliographer was so pleased with this account, that he lifted up his eyes
and hands, and exclaimed, "one grows old always to learn something."</P>

<P>M. Haffner, who was one of the guests at a splendid, but extremely
sociable dinner party at <EM>Madame Franc's</EM><A name="fnref_224"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_224">224</A> the principal banker here--is a
pleasing, communicative, open-countenanced, and open-hearted gentleman. He
may be about sixty years of age. I viewed his library with admiration. The
order was excellent; and considering what were his <EM>means</EM>, I could
not but highly compliment him upon his prudence and enthusiasm. This was
among the happiest illustrations of the <STRONG>Bibliomania</STRONG> which
I had ever witnessed. The owner of this well chosen collection shewed me
with triumph his copy of the first Greek Testament by <EM>Erasmus</EM>,
and his copies of the same sacred book by <EM>R. Stephen</EM> and
<EM>Wetstein</EM>, in folio. Here too I saw a body of philological
theology (if I may use this term) headed by <EM>Walchius</EM> and
<EM>Wolff</EM>, upon the possession of a similar collection of which, my
late neighbour and friend, Dr. Gosset, used to expatiate with delight.</P>

<P>Let me now take you with me out of doors. You love architecture of all
descriptions: but "the olden" is always your "dear delight." In the
construction of the streets of Strasbourg, they generally contrive that
the corner house should <EM>not</EM> terminate with a right angle. Such a
termination is pretty general throughout Strasbourg. Of the differently,
and sometimes curiously, constructed iron bars in front of the windows, I
have also before made mention. The houses are generally lofty; and the
roofs contain two or three tiers of open windows, garret-fashioned; which
gives them a picturesque appearance; but which, I learn, were constructed
as granaries to hold flour--for the support of the inhabitants, when the
city should sustain a long and rigorous siege. As to <EM>very ancient</EM>
houses, I cannot charge my memory with having seen any; and the most
ancient are those on the other side of the <EM>Ill</EM>; of which several
are near the convent before mentioned.</P>

<P>The immediate environs of Strasbourg (as I have before remarked) are
very flat and poor, in a picturesque point of view. They consist chiefly
of fields covered with the <EM>tobacco plant</EM>, which resembles that of
our horse-radish; and the trade of tobacco may be considered the staple,
as well as the indigenous, commodity of the place. This trade is at once
extensive and lucrative; and regulated by very wholesome laws. The
outskirts of the town, considered in an architectural point of view, are
also very indifferent.</P>

<P>As to the general character, or rather appearance, of the
Strasbourgeois, it is such as to afford very considerable satisfaction.
The manners and customs of the people are simple and sober. The women,
even to the class of menial servants, go abroad with their hair brushed
and platted in rather a tasteful manner, as we even sometimes observe in
the best circles of our own country. The hair is dressed <EM>à la
grecque</EM>, and the head is usually uncovered: contrary to the broad
round hats, and depending queues, of the women inhabiting the
neighbourhood of <EM>Saverne</EM>. But you should know that the farmers
about Strasbourg are generally rich in pocket, and choice and dainty in
the disposition of their daughters--with respect to wedlock. They will not
deign to marry them to bourgeois of the ordinary class. They consider the
blood running in their families' veins to be polluted by such an
intermixture; and accordingly they are oftentimes saucy, and hold their
heads high. Even some of the fair dames coming from the high "countre,"
whom we saw kneeling the other day, in the cathedral, with their rural
attire, would not commute their circular head pieces for the most
curiously braided head of hair in the city of Strasbourg.</P>

<P>The utmost order and decency, both in dress and conduct, prevail in the
streets and at spectacles. There seems to be that sober good sense among
the Strasbourgeois--which forms a happy medium between the gaiety of their
western, and the phlegm of their eastern, neighbours; and while this
general good order obtains, we may forgive "officers for mounting guard in
white silk stockings, or for dancing in boots at an assembly--and young
gentlemen for wearing such scanty skirts to their coats:"--subjects, which
appear to have ruffled the good temper of the recent historian of
Strasbourg.<A name="fnref_225"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_225">225</A>
It seems clear that the morals of the community, and especially of the
female part, were greatly benefited by the Reformation,<A name=
"fnref_226"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_226">226</A> or establishment
of the protestant religion.</P>

<P>In alluding to manners and customs, or social establishments of this
place, you ought to know that some have imagined the origin of
<EM>Free-masonry</EM> may be traced to Strasbourg; and that the first
<EM>lodges</EM> of that description were held in this city. The story is
this. The cathedral, considered at the time of its erection as a second
<EM>Solomon's temple</EM>, was viewed as the wonder of the modern world.
Its masons, or architects, were the theme of universal praise. Up rose, in
consequence, the cathedrals of <EM>Vienna, Cologne, Landshut</EM> and
others: and it was resolved that, on the completion of such stately
structures, those, whose mechanical skill had been instrumental to their
erection, should meet in one common bond, and chant together,
periodically, at least their <EM>own</EM> praises. Their object was to be
considered very much above the common labourer, who wore his apron in
front, and carried his trowel in his hand: on the contrary, <EM>they</EM>
adopted, as the only emblems worthy of their profession, the level, the
square, and the compass. All the lodges, wherever established, considered
that of Strasbourg as the common parent; and at a meeting held at Ratisbon
in 1459, it was agreed that the ARCHITECT OF STRASBOURG CATHEDRAL should
be the <EM>Grand Master of Free-masons</EM>; and one DOTZINGER of Worms,
who had succeeded Hulz in 1449, (just after the latter, had finished the
spire) was acknowledged to be the FIRST GRAND MASTER. I own my utter
ignorance in the lore of free-masonry; but have thought it worth while to
send you these particulars: as I know you to be very "curious and prying"
in antiquarian researches connected with this subject.</P>

<P>Strasbourg has been always eminent for its literary reputation, from
the time of the two STURMII, or rather from that of GEYLER, downwards. It
boasts of historians, chroniclers, poets, critics, and philologists. At
this present moment the public school, or university, is allowed to be in
a most flourishing condition; and the name of SCHWEIGHÆUSER alone is
sufficient to rest its pretensions to celebrity on the score of
<EM>classical</EM> acumen and learning. While, within these last hundred
years, the names of SCHOEPFLIN, OBERLIN, and KOCH, form a host in the
department of <EM>topography</EM> and <EM>political economy</EM>.</P>

<P>In <EM>Annals</EM> and <EM>Chronicles</EM>, perhaps no provincial city
in Europe is richer; while in <EM>old Alsatian poetry</EM> there is an
almost inexhaustible banquet to feast upon. M. Engelhardt, the brother in
law of M. Schweighæuser junr. is just now busily engaged in giving an
account of some of the ancient love poets, or <EM>Minne-Singers</EM>; and
he shewed me the other day some curious drawings relating to the same,
taken from a MS. of the XIIIth century, in the public library. But
Oberlin, in 1786, published an interesting work "<EM>De Poetis Alsatiæ
eroticis medii ævi</EM>"--and more lately in 1806; M. Arnold in his
"<EM>Notice littéraire et historique sur les poëtes alsaciens</EM>," 1806,
8vo.--enriched by the previous remarks of Schoepflin, Oberlin, and
Frantz--has given a very satisfactory account of the achievements of the
Muses who seem to have inhabited the mountain-tops of Alsatia--from the
ninth to the sixteenth century inclusively. It is a fertile and an
interesting subject. Feign would I, if space and time allowed, give you an
outline of the same; from the religious metres of <EM>Ottfried</EM> in the
ninth--to the charming and tender touches which are to be found in the
<EM>Hortus deliciarum</EM><A name="fnref_227"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_227">227</A> of <EM>Herade</EM> Abbess of Landsberg, in the
twelfth-century: not meaning to pass over, in my progress, the effusions
of philology and poetry which distinguished the rival abbey of
<EM>Hohenbourg</EM> in the same century. Indeed; not fewer than three
Abbesses--<EM>Rélinde, Herade, and Edelinde</EM>--cultivated literature at
one and the same time: when, in Arnold's opinion, almost the whole of
Europe was plunged in barbarism and ignorance. Then comes
<EM>Günther</EM>, in the fifteenth century; with several brave geniuses in
the intervening period: and, latterly, the collection of the <EM>Old
Troubadour Poetry of Alsace</EM>, by <EM>Roger Maness</EM>--of which there
is a MS. in the Royal Library at Paris; and another (containing matter of
a somewhat later period) in the Public library here; of which latter not a
specimen, as I understand, has seen the light in the form of a printed
text.</P>

<P>In later times, <EM>Brandt, Wimphelin, Locher, Baldus, Pfeffel</EM>,
and <EM>Nicolay</EM>, are enough to establish the cause of good poetry,
and the celebrity of this city in the production of such poets. As to the
<EM>Meister-Sængers</EM> (or Master-Singers) who composed the strains
which they sang, perhaps the cities of Mentz and Nuremberg may vie with
that of Strasbourg, in the production of this particular class. <EM>Hans
Sachs</EM> of Nuremberg, formerly a cobler, was considered to be the very
<EM>Coryphoeus</EM> of these Master-Singers. At the age of fourscore he is

<P>A word or two only respecting the language spoken at Strasbourg. From
the relative situation of the town, this language would necessarily be of
a mixed character: that is to say, there would be intermarriages between
the Germans and French--and the offspring of such marriages would
necessarily speak a <EM>patois</EM>. This seems to be generally admitted.
The ancient language of Strasbourg is said to have been the pure dialect
of <EM>Suabia</EM>; but, at present, the dialect of <EM>Saxony</EM>, which
is thought to be purer as well as more fashionable, is carefully taught in
the schools of both sexes, and spoken by all the ministers in the pulpit.
Luther wrote in this dialect, and all protestant preachers make use of it
as a matter of course. Yet Hermann labours to prove how much softer the
dialect of High Germany is than that of High Saxony. There have lately
appeared several small brochures in the <EM>common language</EM> of the
town--such, of course, as is ordinarily spoken in the shops and streets:
and among others, a comedy called; <EM>Der Pfingst-Montag</EM>, written
(says Hermann) with much spirit; but the author of this latter work has
been obliged to mark the pronunciation, which renders the perusal of it
somewhat puzzling. It is also accompanied with a glossary. But that you,
or your friends, may judge for yourselves, I send you a specimen of the
<EM>patois</EM>, or common language spoken in the street--in the enclosed
ballad: which I purchased the other day, for about a penny of our money,
from an old goody, who was standing upon a stool, and chanting it aloud to
an admiring audience. I send you the first four stanzas.<A name=

<P>DANNBACH is the principal Greek printer of this place; his Greek type
(which I cannot too much commend) is precisely that used in the <EM>Bipont
Thucydydes</EM> and <EM>Plato</EM>. The principal printers, for works in
which the Greek type is not introduced, is LEVRAULT <EM>Pere et Fils</EM>:
and I must say that, if even a fastidious author, a resident
Strasbourgeois,--whose typographical taste had been formed upon the
beautifully executed volumes of Bodoni, Didot, or Bulmer--chose to publish
a fine book, he need not send it to <EM>Paris</EM> to be printed; for M.
Levrault is both a skilful, intelligent, and very able printer and
publisher. I visited him more than once. He has a considerable commercial
establishment. His shop and warehouses are large and commodious; and
Madame Levrault is both active and knowing in aiding and abetting the
concerns of her husband. I should consider their house to be a rich one.
M. Levrault is also a very fair typographical antiquary. He talked of Fust
and Jenson with earnestness, and with a knowledge of their productions;
and told me that he had, up stairs, a room full of old books, especially
of those printed by <EM>Aldus</EM>--and begged I would walk up and inspect
them. You will give me credit for having done so readily. But it was a
"poor affair,"--for the fastidious taste of an Englishman. There was
literally nothing in the way of temptation; and so I abstained from
tempting the possessor by the offer of napoleons or golden ducats. We had
a long and a very gratifying interview; and I think he shewed me (not for
the purpose of sale) a copy of the famous tract of St. Austin, called
<EM>De Arte prædicandi</EM>, printed by <EM>Fust</EM> or by
<EM>Mentelin</EM>; in which however, as the copy was imperfect, he was not
thoroughly conversant. They are all proud at Strasbourg of their
countryman Mentelin, and of course yet more so of Gutenberg; although this
latter was a native of Mentz. Mr. Levrault concluded his conversation by
urging me, in strong terms, to visit <EM>Colmar</EM> ere I crossed the
Rhine; as that place abounded with "DES INCUNABLES TYPOGRAPHIQUES." I told
him that it was impossible; that I had a great deal on my hands to
accomplish on the other side of the Rhine; and that my first great stroke,
in the way of BOOK-ACQUISITIONS, must be struck at <EM>Stuttgart</EM>. M.
Levrault seemed surprised--"for truly," (added he) "there are no
<EM>old</EM> books there, save in the <EM>Public Library</EM>." I smiled,
and wished him a good day.</P>

<P>Upon the whole, my dear friend, I have taken rather an affection for
this place. All classes of people are civil, kind, and communicative: but
my obligations are due, in a more especial manner, to the younger Mr.
Schweighæuser and to Madame Francs. I have passed several pleasant
evenings with the former, and talked much of the literature of our country
with him and his newly married spouse: a lively, lady-like, and
intelligent woman. She is warm in commendation of the <EM>Mary Stuart</EM>
of Schiller; which, in reply to a question on my part, she considers to be
the most impassioned of that Dramatist's performances. Of English she
knows nothing; but her husband is well read in Thomson, Akenside, and
Pope; and of course is sufficiently well acquainted with our language. A
more amiable and zealous man, in the discharge of his duties as a teacher
of youth, the town of Strasbourg does not possess. His little memoir of
Koch has quite won my heart.<A name="fnref_229"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_229">229</A></P>

<P>You have heard me mention the name of OHMACHT, a sculptor. He is much
caressed by the gentry of this place. Madame Francs shewed me what I
consider to be his best performance; a profile, in white marble, of her
late daughter, who died in childbed, in her twenty-first year. It is a
sweet and tender production: executed upon the Greek model--and said to be
a strong resemblance of the deceased. Madame Francs shewed it to me, and
expatiated upon it with tears in her eyes: as she well might--for the
<EM>character</EM> of the deceased was allowed to have been as attractive
as her countenance.<A name="fnref_230"></A><A class="fnref" href=
"#fn_230">230</A> I will candidly confess that, in other respects, I am a
very <EM>qualified</EM> admirer of the talents of Ohmacht. His head of
Oberlin is good; but it is only a profile. I visited his <EM>Studio</EM>,
and saw him busy upon a colossal head of Luther--in a close-grained, but
coarse-tinted, stone. I liked it as little as I have always liked heads of
that celebrated man. I want to see a resemblance of him in which vulgarity
shall be lost in energy of expression. Never was there a countenance which
bespoke greater intrepidity of heart.</P>

<P>I am hastening to the close of this despatch, and to take leave of this
place. Through the interposition of Messrs. Treuttel and Würtz, I have
hired a respectable servant, or laquais, to accompany me to Vienna, and
back again to Manheim. His name is <EM>Rohfritsch</EM>; and he has twice
visited the Austrian capital in the rear of Napoleon's army,--when he was
only in his sixteenth or seventeenth year--as a page or attendant upon one
of the Generals. He talks the French and German languages with equal
fluency. I asked him if we needed fire arms; at which he smiled--as if
wondering at my simplicity or ignorance. In truth, the question was a
little precipitate; for, the other evening, I saw two or three whiskered
Bavarian travellers, starting hence for Munich, in an open, fourgon-shaped
travelling carriage, with two benches across it: on the front bench sat
the two gentlemen, wrapped round with clokes: on the hinder bench, the
servant took his station--not before he had thrown into the carriage two
huge bags of <EM>florins</EM>, as unconcernedly as if they had been bags
of <EM>pebbles</EM>. They were to travel all night--without sabre, pistol,
or carbine, for protection.</P>

<P>I own this gave me a very favourable opinion of the country I was about
to visit; and on recollecting it, had good reason to acquiesce in the
propriety of the smiles of Rohfritsch. Every thing, therefore, is now
settled: gold ducats and silver florins have been obtained from Madame
Francs; and to morrow we start. My next will be from <EM>Stuttgart</EM>--
where a "deed of note" will, I trust, be accomplished. Fare you well.</P>

<DIV class="footnote">
<P><A name="fn_1"></A><A href="#fnref_1">1</A> [Several Notes in this
volume having reference to MONS. CRAPELET, a Printer of very considerable
eminence at Paris, it may be proper to inform the Reader that that portion
of this Tour, which may be said to have a more exclusive reference to
France, usually speaking--including the notice of Strasbourg--was almost
entirely translated by Mons. Crapelet himself. An exception however must
be made to those parts which relate to the <EM>King's Private Library</EM>
at Paris, and to <EM>Strasbourg</EM>: these having been executed by
different pens, evidently in the hands of individuals of less
wrongheadedness and acrimony of feeling than the Parisian Printer. Mons.
Crapelet has prefixed a Preface to his labours, in which he tells the
world, that, using my more favourite metaphorical style of expression, "a
CRUSADE has risen up against the INFIDEL DIBDIN."</P>

<P>Metaphorical as may be this style, it is yet somewhat alarming: for,
most assuredly, when I entered and quitted the "beau pays" of France, I
had imagined myself to have been a courteous, a grateful, and, under all
points of view, an ORTHODOX Visitor. It seems however, from the language
of the French Typographer, that I acted under a gross delusion; and that
it was necessary to have recourse to his sharp-set sickle to cut away all
the tares which I had sown in the soil of his country. Upon the motive and
the merit of his labours, I have already given my unbiassed opinion. <A

equal merit of execution, which has been selected to grace the pages of
this second edition--in the OPPOSITE PLATE. The inscription is as follows:

inferred that the Medal was struck in consequence of the victory of

<P>This last calculation I should think very incorrect. M. Petit Radel
concludes his statement by making the WHOLE NUMBER OF ACCESSIBLE VOLUMES
IN Paris amount to <EM>One Million, one hundred and twenty-five thousand,

60,000 volumes: but I have more faith in the first, than in the second,
computation: not because it comes from myself, but because a pretty long
experience, in the numbering of books, has taught me to be very moderate
in my numerical estimates. I am about to tell the reader rather a curious
anecdote connected with this subject. He may, or he may not, be acquainted
with the Public Library at Cambridge; where, twenty-five years ago, they
boasted of having 90,000 volumes; and now, 120,000 volumes. In the year
1823, I ventured to make, what I considered to be, rather a minute and
carefull calculation of the whole number: and in a sub note in the
<EM>Library Companion</EM>, p. 657, edit. 1824, stated my conviction of
that number's not exceeding 65,000 volumes, including MSS. In the
following year, a very careful estimate was made, by the Librarians, of
the whole number:--and the result was, that there were only.... 64,800

edition of this work, I was too happy to devote the above few pages, is
now NO MORE. Mons. Barbier died in 1825, and his library--the richest in
literary bibliography in Paris,--was sold in 1828. On referring to page
197 ante, it will be seen that I have alluded to a note of M. Barbier's
nephew, of which some mention was to be made in this place. I will give
that note in its <EM>original language</EM>, because the most felicitous
version of it would only impair its force. It is subjoined to these words
of my text: "Be pleased to go strait forward as far as you can see."
"L'homme de service lui-même ne ferait plus cette rêponse aujourd'hui. Peu
de temps après l'impression du Voyage de M. Dibdin, ce qu'on appelle une
<EM>organisation</EM> eut lieu. Après vingt-sept ans de travaux consacrés
à la bibliographique et aux devoirs de sa place, M. Barbier, que ses
fonctions paisibles avoient protégés contre les terribles dénonciations de
1815, n'a pu régister, en 1822, aux délations mensongères de quelque
commis sous M. Lauriston.</P>

<P>I will not pretend to say <EM>what</EM> were the causes which led to
such a disgraceful, because wholly unmerited, result. But I have reason to
BELIEVE that a dirty faction was at work, to defame the character of the
Librarian, and in consequence, to warp the judgment of the Monarch.
Nothing short of infidelity to his trust should have moved SUCH a Man from
the Chair which he had so honourably filled in the private Library of
Louis XVIII. But M. Barbier was beyond suspicion on this head; and in
ability he had perhaps, scarcely an equal--in the particular range of his
pursuits. His <EM>retreating</EM> PENSION was a very insufficient balm to
heal the wounds which had been inflicted upon him; and it was evident to
those, who had known him long and well, that he was secretly pining at
heart, and that his days of happiness were gone. He survived the dismissal
from his beloved Library only five years: dying in the plenitude of mental
vigour. I shall always think of him with no common feelings of regret: for
never did a kinder heart animate a well-stored head. I had hoped, if ever
good fortune should carry me again to Paris, to have renewed, in person,
an acquaintance, than which none had been more agreeable to me, since my
first visit there in 1818: But ... "Diis aliter visum est." There is
however a mournful pleasure in making public these attestations to the
honour of his memory; and, in turn, I must be permitted to quote from the
same author as the nephew of M. Barbier has done....</P>

<P class="poetry">His saltem accumulem donis, et fungar inani<BR>
Munere....</P>

<P>Perhaps the following anecdote relating to the deceased, may be as
acceptable as it is curious. Those of my readers who have visited Paris,
will have constantly observed, on the outsides of houses, the following
letters, painted in large capitals:</P>

<P class="ind2">MACL:</P>

<P>implying--as the different emblems of our Fire Offices imply--</P>

<P class="ind2">"M[aison] A[ssurée] C[ontre] L'[incendie]:"</P>

<P>in plain English, that such houses are insured against fire. Walking
one afternoon with M. Barbier, I pointed to these letters, and said, "You,
who have written upon <EM>Anonymes</EM> and <EM>Pseudonymes</EM>, do you
know what those letters signify?" He replied, "Assuredly--and they can
have but <EM>one</EM> meaning." "What is that?" He then explained them as
I have just explained them. "But (rejoined I) since I have been at Paris,
I have learnt that they also imply <EM>another</EM> meaning." "What might
that be?" Stopping him, and gently touching his arm, and looking round to
see that we were not overheard, I answered in a suppressed tone:--</P>

<P class="ind2">"M[es] A[mis] C[hassez] L[ouis]."</P>

<P>He was thunderstruck. He had never heard it before: and to be told it
by a stranger! "Mais (says he, smiling, and resuming his steps) "voila une
chose infiniment drole!"</P>

<P>Let it be remembered, that this HERETICAL construction upon these
Initial Capitals was put at a time when the <EM>Bonaparte Fever</EM> was
yet making some of the pulses of the Parisians beat 85 strokes to the
minute. <EM>Now</EM>, his Majesty Charles X. will smile as readily at this
anecdote as did the incomparable Librarian of his Regal Predecessor.</P>

<P>OBSERVATION PRELIMINAIRE.</P>

<P>"La production de M. Crapelet rappelée, dans le titre précédent, sera
considérée comme un phénomène dans son genre. Elle est, certes, sans
antécédent et, pour l'honneur de la France, je desire qu'elle n'ait pas
d'imitateurs. Quiconque prendra la peine de lire la trentième lettre de
mon voyage, soit dans l'original, soit dans la version de M. Crapelet, en
laissant de coté les notes qui appartiennent an traducteur, conviendra
facilement que cette lettre manifeste les sentimens les plus impartiaux et
les plus honorables à l'état actuel de la librairie et de l'imprimerie à
Paris. Dans plusieurs passages, où l'on compare l'éxécution typographique,
dans les deux pays, la supériorité est décidée en faveur de la France.
Quant a <EM>l'esprit</EM> qui a dicté cette lettre, je déclare, comme
homme d'honneur, ne l'avoir pas composée, dans un systême d'opposition,
envers ceux qu'elle concerne plus particulièrement.</P>

<P>"Cependant, il n'en a pas moins plu à M. Crapelet, imprimeur de Paris,
l'un de ceux dont il y est fait plus spécialement l'éloge, d'accompagner
sa traduction de cette lettre, de notes déplacées et injurieuses pour le
caractère de l'auteur et de son ouvrage. Par suite probablement du peu
d'étendue de ses idées et de l'organisation vicieuse de ses autres sens,
ce typographe s'est livré a une séries d'observations qui outragent autant
la raison que la politesse, et qui décèlent hautement sa malignité et sa
noirceur. Les formes de son procédé ne sont pas moins méprisables que le
fond. Avec la prétention avouée de ne répandre que partiellement sa
version,</P>

<P>(Voulant blesser et cependant timide pour frapper)</P>

<P>il s'est servi de ses propres presses et il a imprimé le texte et les
notes avec des caractères et sur un papier aussi semblables que possible à
ceux de l'ouvrage qu'il venait de traduire. Il en a surveillé, a ce qu'on
assure, l'impression, avec l'attention personelle la plus scrupuleuse, en
sorte qu'il n'est aucune <EM>epreuvé égarée</EM>, qui ait été soumise à
d'autres yeux que les siens. Il a prit soin, en outre, d'en faire tirer,
au moins, cent exemplaires, et de les répandre. <A name="fnref_C"></A><A
class="fnref" href="#fn_C">C</A> Comme ces cent exemplaires seront
probablement lus par dix fois le même nombre de personnes, il y aurait eu
plus de franchisé et peut-être plus de bon sens de la part de M. Crapelet
à diriger publiquement ses coups contre moi que de le faire sous la
couverture d'un <EM>pamphlet privé</EM>. Il a fait choix de ce genre
d'attaque; il ne me reste plus qu'à adopter une semblable méthode de
défense: si ce n'est, qu'au lieu de cent exemplaires, ces remarques ne
seront véritablement imprimée qu'a <EM>trente six</EM>. Ce procédé est
certes plus délicat que celui de mon adversaire; mais soit que M. Crapelet
ait préféré l'obscurité à la lumière, il n'en est pas moins évident que
son intention a été d'employer tous ses petits moyens, a renverser la
réputation d'un ouvrage, dont il avoue lui-même avoir à peine lu la
cinquantième partie!</P>

<P>"Par le contenu de ses notes, on voit qu'il a cherché, avec une
assiduité condamnable, a recueillir le mal qu'il me suppose avoir eu
l'intention de dire des personnes que j'ai citées, et cependant, après
tout ce travail, a peine a-t-il pû découvrir l'ombre d'une seule allusion
maligne. Jamais on ne fit un usage plus déplorable de son tems et de ses
peines, car toutes les phrases de cette production sont aussi obscures que
tirées de loin.</P>

<P>"Il est difficile, ainsi que je l'ai déjà observé, de se rendre compte
des motifs d'une telle conduite. Mais M. Crapelet n'a fait part de son
secret à personne, et d'après l'échantillon dont il s'agit ici, je n'ai
nulle envie de le lui demander.</P>

toutefois, ainsi que le lecteur pourra s'en appercevoir, laisser tomber
dans l'oubli le mérite des notes. Encore un mot; M. Crapelet m'a attaqué

<P><A name="fn_132"></A><A href="#fnref_132">132</A> The year following
the above description, the Catalogue, alluded to, made its appearance
under the title of "<EM>Catalogue de la Bibliothèque d'un Amateur</EM>,"
in four not <EM>very</EM> capacious octavo volumes: printed by CRAPELET,
who finds it impossible to print--<EM>ill</EM>. I am very glad such a
catalogue has been published; and I hope it will be at once a stimulus and
a model for other booksellers, with large and curious stocks in hand, to
do the same thing. But I think M. Renouard might have conveniently got the
essentials of his bibliographical gossipping into <EM>two</EM> volumes;
particularly as, in reading such a work, one must necessarily turn rapidly
over many leaves which contain articles of comparatively common
occurrence, and of scarcely common interest. It is more especially in
regard to <EM>modern</EM> French books, of which he seems to rejoice and
revel in the description--(see, among other references, vol. iii. p.
286-310) that we may be allowed to regret such dilated statements; the
more so, as, to the fastidious taste of the English, the engravings, in
the different articles described, have not the beauty and merit which are
attached to them by the French. Yet does M. Renouard narrate pleasantly,
and write elegantly.</P>

<P>In regard to the "<EM>brush</EM> at the Decameron," above alluded to, I

triumph as a sportsman does a "brush" of a different description! Was it
<EM>originally</EM> more <EM>piquan?</EM> I have reason not only to
suspect, but to know, that it WAS. Be this as it may, I should never, in
the first place, have been backward in returning all home thrusts upon the
aggressor- -and, in the second place, I am perfectly disposed that my work
may stand by the test of such criticism. It is, upon the whole, fair and
just; and <EM>justice</EM> always implies the mention of <EM>defects</EM>
as well as of excellencies. It may, however, be material to remark, that
the <EM>third</EM> volume of the Decameron is hardly amenable to the

<EM>Ovid De Tristilus, translated by Churchyard</EM>, 1578, 4to. (his

morocco, with vellum linings, within a broad border of gold, and all other
similar seductive adjuncts. Lewis considered it as a CHALLENGE to the

<P>This curious production is dedicated to the Author's Son: his first
workman; seventeen years of age; and "as knowing, in his business at that
early period of life as his father was at the age of twenty-seven." The
dedication is followed by a preface, and an advertisement, or "Idée
analytique de la Reliure." In the preface, the author deprecates both
precipitate and severe criticism; "He is himself but a book-binder--and
what can be expected from a muse so cultivated?" He doubts whether it will
be read all through; but his aim and object have been to fix, upon a solid
basis, the fundamental principles of his art. The subject, as treated in
the Dictionary of Arts and Trades by the French Academy, is equally scanty
and inaccurate. The author wishes that all arts were described by artists,
as the reader would gain in information what he would lose in style. "I
here repeat (says he) what I have elsewhere said in bad verse. There are
amateur-collectors who know more about book-binding, than even certain
good workmen; but there are also others, of a capricious taste, who are
rather likely to lead half-instructed workmen astray, than to put them in
the proper road." In the poetical epistle which concludes the preface, he
tells us that he had almost observed the Horatian precept: his poem having
cost eight years labour. The opening of it may probably be quite
sufficient to give the reader a proper notion of its character and
merits.</P>

<EM>Thucydides</EM> was published first; in twelve volumes 8vo. VOL. II.
1807; with various readings, for the first time, from thirteen MSS. not
before submitted to the public eye. The French version, in four volumes,
with the critical notes of the Editor, may be had separately. The VELLUM
4to. copy of the Thucydides consists of fourteen volumes; but as the
volumes are less bulky than those of the Xenophon, they may be reduced to
seven. The <EM>Xenophon</EM> was published in 1809, in seven volumes, 4to.
The Latin version is that of Leunclavius; the French version and critical
notes are those of M. Gail. The vellum copy, above alluded to, is divided
into ten volumes; the tenth being an Atlas of fifty-four maps. Some of
these volumes are very bulky from the thickness of the vellum.</P>

<P>Upon this unique copy, M. Gail submitted to me, in writing, the
following remarks. "Of the Xenophon, two vellum copies were printed; but
of these, one was sent to the father of the present King of Spain, and
received by him in an incomplete state--as the Spanish Ambassador told M.
Gail: only six volumes having reached the place of their destination. The
Editor undertakes to give authenticated attestations of this fact." "If,"
say M. Gail's written observations, "one considers that each sheet of
vellum, consisting of eight pages, cost five francs ten sous, and three
more francs in working off--and that skins of vellum were frequently
obliged to be had from foreign countries, owing to the dearth of them at
Paris--whereby the most extravagant demands were sometimes obliged to be
complied with--add to which, that fifteen years have passed away since
these sums were paid down in hard cash,--the amount of the original
expenses is doubled." The volumes are in stout boards, and preserved in
cases. In one of his letters to me, respecting the sale of his vellum
copy- -the worthy Professor thus pleasantly remarks: "Je ne veux pas
m'enricher avec ce livre qui, lorsque je serai cendres, aura un bien grand
prix. Je n'ai que le desir de me débarrasser d'une richesse qui m'est à
charge, et ne convient nullement à un modeste et obscur particulier, comme
moi." I subjoin the autograph of this worthy and learned Professor: hoping
yet to shake the hand heartily which guided the pen.</P>

<P><A name="fn_160"></A><A href="#fnref_160">160</A> M. Millin DIED about
the middle of the following month, ere I had reached Vienna. His library
was sold by auction in May 1819, under the superintendence of Messrs.
Debure, who compiled the sale catalogue. It produced 53,626 francs. The
catalogue contained 2556 articles or numbers; of which several were very
long sets. One article alone, no. 866., consisted of 326 volumes in folio,
quarto, and octavo. It is thus designated, "RECUEIL DE PIECES SUR LES
ARTS, LA LITTE'RATURE, LES ANTIQUITE'S, <EM>en Latin, en Italien, et en
François</EM>. This article produced 4501 francs, and was purchased by the
Grand Duke of Tuscany. Millin had brought up from boyhood, and rescued
from poverty and obscurity, a lad of the name of <EM>Mention</EM>. This
lad lived with him many years, in the capacity of a valet and private
secretary. In his second and last voyage to Italy, Millin declined taking
him with him, but left him at home, in his house, with a salary of fifty
francs per month. Five months after his departure, in February, 1812, a
great quantity of smoke was seen issuing from the windows of Millin's
apartments. Several people rushed into the room. They found the drawings
and loose papers taken from the portfolios, rolled up lightly, and the
room on fire at the four corners! A lighted candle was placed in the
middle of the room. Suspicion immediately fell upon Mention. They ran to
his bed chamber: found the door fastened: burst it open--and saw the
wretched valet weltering in his blood ... yet holding, in his-right hand,
the razor with which he had cut his throat! He was entirely dead. Millin's
collection of Letters from his numerous Correspondents perished in the
flames.</P>

<P>This accident, which also deprived Millin of a fund of valuable
materials that he was preparing for a <EM>Dictionary of the Fine
Arts</EM>, and for a <EM>Recueil de Pièces gravées Inédites</EM>--might
have also had an infinitely more fatal tendency: as it occurred
<EM>within</EM> the walls which contain the ROYAL LIBRARY! Millin received
the news of this misfortune, in Italy, with uncommon fortitude and
resignation. But this second voyage, as has been already intimated, (see
p. 260) hastened his dissolution. He planned and executed infinitely too
much; and never thoroughly recovered the consequent state of exhaustion of
body and mind. As he found his end approaching, he is reported to have
said--"I should like to have lived longer, in order to have done more
good--but God's will be done! I have lived fifty-nine years, the happiest
of men--and should I not be ungrateful towards Providence, if I complained
of its decrees?!" And when still nearer his latter moments--he exclaimed:
"I have always lived, and I die, a Frenchman: hating no one: complaining
only of those who retard the cause of reason and truth. I have never,
intentionally, hurt a single creature. If I have injured any one, I ask
pardon of him for the error of my understanding." He died on the 18th of
August, and his body was interred in the churchyard of Père la Chaise. His
old friend and colleague, M. GAIL, pronounced a funeral discourse over his
grave--in which, as may be well supposed, his feelings were most acutely
excited. I subjoin a facsimile of Millin's autograph: from the richly
furnished collection of Mr. Upcott, of the London Institution.</P>

MM. VANPRAET, LANGLE'S, GAIL, et MILLIN. On pense bien que l'histoire
littéraire, la bibliographie, devinrent un inépuisable sujet pour la

convient aux banquets des muses; et selon l'adage antique, les convives
étoient plus que trois et moins que neuf. M. Gail lut sur cette réunion

<P>While one of the London morning newspapers (which shall be here
nameless) chose to convert this harmless scene of festive mirth into a
coarse and contemptible attack upon its author, the well-bred Bibliomanes
of Paris viewed it with a different feeling, and drew from it a more
rational inference. It was supposed, by several gentlemen of education and
fortune, that a RIVAL SOCIETY might be established among themselves--
partaking in some degree of the nature of that of the ROXBURGHE, although
necessarily regulated by a few different laws.</P>

<P>Taking the regulations of the ROXBURGHE CLUB (as laid down in the
<EM>Ninth Day</EM> of the <EM>Decameron</EM>) as the basis, they put
together a code of laws for the regulation of a similar Society which they
chose, very aptly, to call LES BIBLIOPHILES. Behold then, under a new
name, a <EM>Parisian Roxburghe Society</EM>. When I visited Paris, in the
summer, of 1819, I got speedily introduced to the leading Members of the
club, and obtained, from M. DURAND DE LANÇON, (one of the most devoted and
most efficient of the members) that information--which is here submitted
to the public: from a persuasion that it cannot be deemed wholly
uninteresting, or out of order, even by the most violent enemies of the
<STRONG>cause</STRONG>." The <EM>object</EM> of this Society of the
BIBLIOPHILES must be expressed in the proper language of the country. It
is "<EM>pour nourrir, reléver, et faire naître méme la passion de la</EM>
<STRONG>Bibliomanie</STRONG>." I put it to the conscience of the most
sober-minded observer of men and things--if any earthly object can be more
orthodox and legitimate? The Society meet, as a corporate body, twice in
the year: once in April, the second time in December; and date the
foundation of their Club from the 1st of January 1820. Whatever they
print, bears the general title of "<EM>Mélanges</EM>;" <A name=
"fnref_G"></A><A class="fnref" href="#fn_G">G</A> but whether this word
will be executed in the black-letter, lower-case, or in roman capitals, is
not yet determined upon. One or two things, however, at starting, cannot
fail to be premised; and indeed has been already observed upon--as a
species of <EM>heresy</EM>. The Society assemble to a "déjeuné à la
fourchette," about twelve o'clock: instead of to a "seven o'clock dinner,"
as do the London Roxburghers: whereby their constitutions and pockets are
less affected. The other thing, to observe upon, is, that they do not
print (and publish among themselves) such very strange, and out-of-the way
productions, as do the London Roxburghers. For truly, of <EM>some</EM> of
the latter, it may be said with the anonymous poet in the
<EM>Adversaria</EM> of Barthius,</P>

<P class="poetry">Verum hæc nee puer edidici, nee tradita patre<BR>
 Accepi, nee Aristotelis de moribus umquam<BR>

<P class="poetry"><EM>Edit. Fabri</EM>. 1624, col. 345, vol. i.</P>

<P>And why is it thus? Because these reprints are occasionally taken
(quoting Caspar Barthius himself, in the xxth chapter of his iid book of
Adversaria, <EM>Edit. Ead</EM>.) "ex libro egregiè obscuro et a blattis
tineisque fere confecto." But, on the other hand, they are perfectly
harmless:</P>

time to be at Paris, also received the honour of an invitation. The
festival took place at <EM>Beauvilliers'</EM>, the modern Apicius of
Parisian restorateurs. About twelve guests sat down to table. The Marquis
de Chateaugiron was in the chair. They assembled at six, and separated at
half-past nine. All that refinement and luxury could produce, was produced
on the occasion. Champagnes of different tints, and of different
qualities- -<EM>lively</EM> like M. Langlès, or <EM>still</EM> like
Monsieur ****; fish, dressed as they dress it à la Rocher de
Cancale--poultry, and pastry-- varied in form, and piquant in taste--but
better, and more palatable than either, conversation--well regulated and
instructive--mingled with the most respectful attention to the ILLUSTRIOUS
GUEST for whom the banquet had been prepared--gave a charm and a
"joyaunce" to the character of that festival-- which will not be easily
effaced from the tablets of the narrator's memory. Where all shine pretty
equally, it seems invidious to particularise. Yet I may be allowed to
notice the hearty urbanity of the Marquis, the thorough good humour and
bibliomaniacal experience of the Comte d'Ourches, (who, ever and anon,
would talk about an edition of <EM>Virgil's Pastorals printed by
Eggesteyn</EM>) the vivacious sallies of the Chevalier Langlès, the keen
yet circumspect remarks of the Comte Noailles, the vigilant attention and

ANTONIOS. Since the sale of the <EM>Silvestre</EM> Collection, in 1810,
nothing had been seen at Paris like that of M. Denon. It was begun to be
formed in the eighteenth century: from which it is clear, that, not only
was every proof at least an hundred years old, but, at that period,
ZANETTI, the previous possessor of this Collection, sought far and wide,
and with unremitting diligence, for the acquisition of the choicest
impressions of the engraver. In fact, this Collection, (contained in an
imperial folio volume, bound in morocco--and of which I necessarily took
but a hasty glance) consisted of 117 <EM>original</EM> impressions, and of
26 of such as were executed in the <EM>school</EM> of M. Antonio. Of the
original impressions, the whole, with the exception of four only, belonged
to Zanetti. "If, says the compiler of the Catalogue, (1826, 8vo. p. ij.)
some of the impressions have a dingy tint, from the casualties of time,
none have been washed, cleaned, or passed through chemical experiments to
give them a treacherous look of cleanliness." This is sound orthodoxy. The
whole was put up in one lot, and ... BOUGHT IN.</P>

<P>Secondly, for the REMBRANDTS. The like had never been before submitted
to public auction. The Collections of <EM>Silvestre</EM> and <EM>Morel de
Vindé</EM> out and out eclipsed! <EM>Zanetti</EM> again--the
incomparable--the felicitous--the unrivalled Zanetti had been the
possessor of THIS Collection also. But yet more ... John Peter Zoomer, a
contemporary (and peradventure a boon companion) of Rembrandt, was the
original former of the Collection. It is therefore announced as being
COMPLETE in all respects--"exhibiting all the changes, retouches,
beautiful proofs, on India and other paper: ample margins, unstained,
uninjured; and the impressions themselves, in every stage, bright, rich,
and perfect. The result of all the trouble and expence of 50 years toil of
collection is concentrated in this Collection." So says John Peter Zoomer,
the original collector and contemporary of Rembrandt. It consisted of 394
original pieces: 3, attributed to Rembrandt, without his name: 11, of John
Lievens, Ferdinand Bol, and J.G. Villet: 11 copies: and 9 engraved in the
manner of Rembrandt. The whole contained in 3 large folio volumes, bound
in red morocco.</P>

<P>No reasonable man will expect even a précis of the treasures of this
marvellous Collection: A glance of the text will justify every thing to
follow: but the "Advertisement" to the Catalogue prepares the purchaser
for the portrait of <EM>Rembrandt with the bordered cloak</EM>--Ditto,
<EM>with the Sabre--Ephraim Bonus</EM> with the <EM>black ring</EM>--the
<EM>Coppinol</EM>, as above described--the <EM>Advocate Tolling</EM>--the

<EM>Landscapes</EM> not elsewhere to be found--of which one, called the
<EM>Fishermen</EM> (No. 456) had escaped Bartsch, &amp;c. &amp;c. The
descriptions of the several articles of which this Collection was
composed, occupy 47 pages of the Catalogue. The three volumes were put up
to sale--as a SINGLE LOT-- at the price of 50,000 francs:--and there was
<EM>no purchaser</EM>. Of its present destiny, I am ignorant: but there
are those in this country, who, to my knowledge, would have given 35,000
francs.</P>

<P>I ought to add, that M. Denon's collection of CALLOT'S WORKS, in three
large folio volumes,--bound in calf--also once the property of
Zanetti--and than which a finer set is supposed never to have been
exhibited for sale--produced 1000 francs: certainly a moderate sum, if
what Zanetti here says of it (in a letter to his friend Gaburri, of the
date of 1726) be true. "If ever you do this country (Venice) the honour of
a visit, you will see in my little cabinet a collection of CALLOTS, such
as you will not see elsewhere--not in the royal collection at Paris, nor
in the Prince Eugene's, at Vienna--where the finest and rarest impressions
are supposed to be collected. I possess <EM>every</EM> impression of the
plates which Callot executed; many of them containing first proofs,
retouched and corrected by the engraver himself in red chalk. I bought
this Collection at Paris, and it cost me 1950 francs. They say it was
formed by the engraver himself for his friend M. Gérard an Amateur of
Prints." "It should seem that Zanetti's description was a little
overcharged; but in <EM>his</EM> time there was no complete catalogue of
the artists." Cat. p. 153.</P>

<P><A name="fn_H"></A><A href="#fnref_H">H</A> It formed No. 345 of the
Catalogue; where it is described as being "a magnificent proof upon India
paper, with a margin of 15 lines all round it. It was with the bur, and
before the cross-hatchings upon the mane of the Ass." The finest copy of
this subject, sold in this country, was that formerly in the collection of
M. Bernard; and recently purchased by T. Wilson, Esq. Will the reader

towers--surmounted, in turn, by nearly thirty towers of observation on the
exterior of the walls. But in the beginning of the sixteenth century, from
the general adoption of gunpowder in the art of war, a different system of
defence was necessarily adopted; and the number of these towers was in
consequence diminished. At present there are none. They are supplied by
bastions and redoubts, which answer yet better the purposes of
warfare.</P>

considered to be the best place for a view of the cathedral. The Robertsau
is a well peopled and well built suburb. It consists of three nearly
parallel streets, composed chiefly of houses separated by gardens--the
whole very much after the English fashion. In short, these are the country
houses of the wealthier inhabitants of Strasbourg; and there are upwards
of seventy of them, flanked by meadows, orchards, or a fruit or kitchen
garden. It derives the name of <EM>Robertsau</EM> from a gentleman of the
name of <EM>Robert,</EM> of the ancient family of <EM>Bock</EM>. He first
took up his residence there about the year 1200, and was father of twenty

back as the time of the Romans." See <EM>Hermann</EM>; vol. i. p. 128,
note 20: whose compressed account of a few of these castellated mansions
is well worth perusal, I add this note, from something like a strong
persuasion, that, should it meet the eye of some enterprising and

requires six men to toll it. In regard to the height, I must not be
supposed to speak from absolute data. Yet I apprehend that its altitude is
not much over-rated. Grandidier has quite an amusing chapter (p. 241,

<P><A name="fn_211"></A><A href="#fnref_211">211</A> I think this volume
is of the date of 1580. CONRAD DASYPODIUS was both the author of the work,
and the chief mechanic or artisan employed in making the clock--about
which he appears to have taken several journeys to employ, and to consult
with, the most clever workmen in Germany. The wheels and movements were
made by the two HABRECHTS, natives of Schaffhausen.</P>

<P><A name="fn_214"></A><A href="#fnref_214">214</A> My French translator

funereal monuments which the modern chisel has produced." It may be, in
the estimation of <EM>some</EM>--but certainly of a <EM>very small</EM>

rien derobé!" And he then quotes, apparently with infinite delight, a
passage from the <EM>Quarterly Review</EM>, (No. LXIII. June 1825) in
which I am designated as having "extraordinary talents for ridicule!" But
how my talents "for ridicule" (of which I very honestly declare my
unconsciousness) can be supposed to bear upon the above "prick of
conscience," is a matter which I have yet to learn. My amiable friend
might have perhaps somewhat exceeded the prescribed line of his duty in
letting me have the key of the Library in question--but, can a declaration

of a physician living in one of the smaller towns near the Vosges. This

morality, was the late lamented and ever memorable KOCH. Before the year
1536, it should seem, from Koch's statement, that even whole streets as
well as houses were occupied by women of a certain description. After this
year, there were only two houses of ill fame left. The women, of the
description before alluded to, used to wear black and white hats, of a
sugar-loaf form, over the veil which covered their faces; and they were
confined strictly to this dress by the magistrates. These women were
sometimes represented in the sculptured figures about the cathedral.
Hermann says that there may yet be seen, over the door of a house in the
<EM>Bickergase</EM> (one of the streets now called <EM>Rue de la
fontaine</EM>, which was formerly devoted to the residence of women of ill
fame) a bas- relief, representing two figures, with the following German
inscription beneath:</P>

<P class="poetry"><STRONG>Diss haus steht in Gottes Hand<BR>

<P>It should seem, therefore, (continues Hermann) that this was one of the
houses in which a public officer attended, to keep order, prevent
quarrels, and exact municipal rights. The book, in which the receipt of
this tax was entered, existed during the time of the Revolution, and is
thought to be yet in existence. Hermann, vol. i. p. 156.</P>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
